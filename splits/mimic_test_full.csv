 Bedside upright AP radiograph of the chest demonstrates little interval change
 when compared to prior study performed 24 hours ago.  There is minimal, stable
 enlargement of the cardiomediastinal contours consistent with mild chronic
 heart failure.  Persistent obscuration of the pulmonary vascular markings in
 the right lung base is consistent with trace pulmonary edema.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis is still present.  The lungs are otherwise clear.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  A left internal jugular central venous
 catheter, an endotracheal tube, and an orogastric tube are unchanged and
 appropriately positioned.  The chronic findings of atherosclerotic
 calcification of the aortic arch and bilateral glenohumeral joint degenerative
 changes are once again noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Mild chronic congestive heart failure with stable trace pulmonary edema at
 the right lung base.
 2.  Stable bibasilar atelectasis.

 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with EKG changes and fever.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single portable view of the chest is compared to previous exam from
 ___.  Tracheostomy tube is again noted.  Left PICC tip is not
 clearly delineated on the current exam.  Again there is mild pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  Streaky opacities at the lung bases suggestive of
 atelectasis; however infection cannot be excluded.  Cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is stable as are the osseous and soft tissue structures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change since prior.  Pulmonary vascular
 congestion.  Bibasilar opacities potentially due to atelectasis; however,
 infection is not excluded.

 HISTORY:  CHF and sepsis, for PICC placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, the PICC extends only to the left
 brachiocephalic vein before its junction with the superior vena cava. 
 Continued low lung volumes may account for some of the prominence of the
 transverse diameter of the heart.  Bibasilar opacification most likely
 reflects atelectatic changes.  Possibility of supervening pneumonia would have
 to be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.
 
 The pulmonary vascular congestion is less prominent than on the prior study.

 HISTORY:  Tachypnea, history of pseudomonas pneumonia, question new
 infiltrate.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated, suggesting background COPD.  Heart size is
 borderline.  There is hazy opacity at the left lung base, consistent with a
 small left effusion and underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  The
 differential diagnosis includes a pneumonic infiltrate in this area.  Crowding
 of vessels in the right cardiophrenic region and left infrahilar regions are
 noted.  These findings are similar but slightly more pronounced compared with
 multiple earlier films and could reflect atelectasis, as well as patient's
 known bronchiectatic changes.  A Dobbhoff-type tube is present, extending
 beyond the inferior edge of the film -- the visualized segment of the
 radiopaque portion is seen overlying the gastric fundus.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Small left effusion with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  In the
 appropriate clinical setting, the differential would include a pneumonic
 infiltrate.  Findings discussed with the covering house officer on the
 afternoon of the exam.

 PORTABLE SEMI-ERECT FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  A left Port-A-Cath terminates
 in the right atrium, unchanged from prior.  Lung volumes are extremely low
 resulting in bronchovascular crowding and limited evaluation of the lung
 bases.  Diffuse interstitial opacities have increased, and despite the low
 lung volumes, findings are consistent with superimposed pulmonary edema on a
 background of pulmonary fibrosis. No large pleural effusion is evident.  There
 is no pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are within normal

 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with interstitial lung disease presenting with
 respiratory distress. Evaluate for congestive heart failure.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiographs from ___ and ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Lung volumes are low. Extensive bilateral opacities are unchanged from the
 prior examination and likely reflect the patient underlying severe
 interstitial lung disease.  There is possibly increased opacification of the
 right lower lung, which may represent mild edema. Hilar and cardiomediastinal
 contours are unchanged.  Calcification of the aortic arch is noted. There is
 no pneumothorax. There is no pleural effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Minimally increased opacification of the right lower lung may reflect mild
 edema superimposed on chronic severe interstitial lung disease.

 HISTORY:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP view of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___.  Chest CT ___ 
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Low lung volumes are again demonstrated.  Chronic interstitial abnormality is
 again seen as well as more focal opacities within the left lung base, left
 perihilar region, and right upper lobe which are not significantly changed
 when compared to the prior exam.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours
 are relatively unchanged with marked calcification of the aortic knob.  No
 pneumothorax or large pleural effusion is demonstrated.  The right PICC has
 been removed.  Assessment of the pulmonary vascularity is limited.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Relatively unchanged appearance of the chest compared to prior exam.
 Persistent opacities within the right upper lobe, left lung base and left
 perihilar region are redemonstrated on a background of chronic interstitial
 lung disease which on the prior chest CT was thought to reflect UIP or
 fibrosing NSIP.  As before, these more focal opacities may reflect progression
 of chronic interstitial lung disease, acute exacerbation of interstitial lung
 disease, or possibly infection.

 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with endocarditis and intubated.
 
 STUDY:  Portable AP semi-upright chest radiograph.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The endotracheal tube tip sits 5 cm above the carina.  A left-sided
 IJ central venous catheter tip sits in the left brachiocephalic vein.  The
 right-sided IJ central venous catheter tip sits in the upper SVC.  The heart
 size is large but stable.  The mediastinal contours are within normal limits. 
 There continue to be bibasilar and perihilar opacities as well as a more
 rounded confluent opacity in the right upper lung.  These findings likely
 represent increased pulmonary edema as well as right upper and lower lobe
 consolidations.  Retrocardiac opacity is also compatible with a left lower
 lobe consolidation.  The costophrenic angles are excluded from the study
 limiting assessment for subtle pleural effusion.  There is no large
 pneumothorax.

 effusion has minimally decreased.  On the left, however, the effusion has
 substantially increased and leads to a near total opacification of the left
 hemithorax.  Subsequently, severe atelectatic changes are present.
 
 The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed, the right internal jugular vein
 catheter has also been removed, a nasogastric tube, the endotracheal tube and
 a venous introduction sheath remains in situ.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Hematemesis, status post nasogastric tube placement.  Evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient has been
 intubated.  The tip of the endotracheal tube projects 2.8 cm above the carina.
 The patient has also received a nasogastric tube.  The course of the tube is
 unremarkable, the tip of the tube is not visible on the current image.  The
 right internal jugular vein catheter is in unchanged position.
 
 The atelectatic opacity at the right lung base is slightly increasing.  There
 also is a disruption in the air column of the right main bronchus, so that
 bronchoscopic evaluation or clearance of potentially present mucus might be
 indicated.

 Chest tube remains in place and there is no evidence of pneumothorax.  The
 right lung is essentially clear except for some residual atelectatic change at
 the base.
 
 The gas along the upper chest border on the left and subcutaneous tissues is
 decreasing.  There appears to be some increase in the extensive opacification
 in the left hemithorax.  This could reflect additional pleural fluid, though
 in the appropriate clinical setting, the possibility of supervening pneumonia
 would have to be considered.

 FINDINGS:
 
 Lung volumes are low, limiting evaluation of the lung bases, with perihilar
 atelectasis.  Within this limitation, no focal consolidation, pleural
 effusion, pneumothorax, or pulmonary edema is seen.  The aorta is tortuous. 
 Heart size is difficult to evaluate in the setting of markedly low lung
 volumes.  A right-sided Port-A-Cath tip projects at the level of the
 cavoatrial junction, as seen previously.  Density in the aortopulmonary window
 appears similar compared to prior and likely corresponds to calcified nodes,
 as seen on prior CT.  Sternal wires appear intact.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 Low lung volumes, limiting evaluation of the lung bases and heart size,
 without radiographic evidence for acute cardiopulmonary process on this single
 frontal view.

 with SOB  // evaluate for pneumonia. pneuthorax
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 As compared to recent radiograph from a few hr earlier, the patient has
 reportedly undergone a tracheobronchial stent placement.  Extensive
 pneumomediastinum is new, and accompanied by subcutaneous emphysema in the
 supraclavicular, cervical and chest wall regions.  Small bilateral
 pneumothoraces are also demonstrated.  Cardiac silhouette demonstrates left
 ventricular configuration is accompanied by pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Asymmetrically distributed heterogeneous opacities in the right mid and lower
 lobe could reflect asymmetrical edema, aspiration, or hemorrhage in the post
 procedural setting.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 Pneumomediastinum and bilateral small pneumothoraces following
 tracheobronchial stent placement.  The findings are concerning for
 tracheobronchial rupture.

 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW, LORDOTIC POSITIONING.  
 
 Low inspiratory volumes.  There is a small left effusion and possibly a small
 right effusion.  There is increased retrocardiac density and right infrahilar
 density consistent with lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation.  The
 superior mediastinum is not well demonstrated on this view due to lordotic
 positioning. There is upper zone redistribution, likely accentuated by low
 lung volumes.  The degree of retrocardiac opacity is greater and the left
 effusion is new, compared with the film dated ___ at 18:37 p.m.  
 
 Chondroid calcifications in the diaphysis of the right proximal humerus are
 noted, extending beyond the infeiror edge of this film, over a length of at
 least 4 cm. In the absence of atypical upper arm pain, this likely represents
 a benign enchondroma.  
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bibasilar opacities, worse on the left, with possible new left effusion.  
 2.  Limited assessment of superior mediastinum due to lordotic positioning.
 3.  Probable right humeral diaphysis enchondroma.  When the patient is stable,
 recommend clinical correlation to exclude any right humeral atypical pain and
 baseline right humerus radiographs to include the entire lesion.

 AP CHEST, 6:37 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  MI.  Hypoxia.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Moderately severe pulmonary edema is evenly distributed in the left lung.  On
 the right, there is greater perihilar opacification extending into the lower
 lobe which could be asymmetric edema or concurrent pneumonia.  A roughly
 spherical ___-mm wide opacity filling the apex of the right hemithorax should
 be considered a lung mass until proved otherwise.
 
 There is no appreciable pleural effusion.  Heart size is normal.  Pulmonary
 vasculature is engorged.  Bulge in the left lower mediastinal contour is
 probably due to hiatus hernia, but could be a paraspinal lesion.  Findings
 discussed by telephone at the time of dictation with Dr. ___.

 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal chest radiograph was obtained portably with the
 patient in a supine position.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is persistent opacification of the right lower lung field,
 likely due to known pleural effusion and atelectasis.  Small left pleural
 effusion is again noted.  Overall, there has been no significant interval
 change.  Endotracheal tube, left internal jugular catheter, and esophageal
 catheter are again seen in similar positions with esophageal catheter tip out
 of view.  No pneumothorax is detected.

 COMPARISON:  No prior studies available for comparison.
 
 FINDINGS:  Chest PA and lateral radiograph demonstrates a markedly elevated
 right hemidiaphragm with adjacent compressive atelectasis or consolidation. 
 Minimal blunting of the posterior costophrenic angle may indicate a small
 right pleural effusion.  Left lung is clear.  Cardiomediastinal borders are

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Right loculated pleural effusion, status post pigtail placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a pigtail was introduced
 into the right pleural cavity.  The major part of the pre-existing right
 pleural effusion appears to be drained.  However, a new air inclusion in the
 right basal pleural space.  This pleural air does not manifest as an apical
 pneumothorax.  In fact, in the apical and lateral parts of the right
 hemithorax, there is still abundant fluid visualized.
 
 The volume of the right hemithorax, overall, has not increased.  However, a
 short-term followup is required to assess for potential developing tension.
 
 Normally appearing lung parenchyma on the left.  Unchanged left heart border
 and tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, there is
 increasing indistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels, consistent with
 worsening vascular congestion.  Continued elevation of the right

 subpulmonic effusion or an intrinsic diaphragmatic abnormality or enlarged
 liver.  Left lung is essentially unchanged except for worsening pulmonary
 vascular congestion.

 HISTORY:  Status post thrombectomy, low-grade fever, leukocytosis; question
 pneumonia, atelectasis.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW:  This is a redictation of a prior dictation
 that apparently did not go through. 
 
 There is slightly rotated positioning.  Compared with earlier the same day
 (___:___ p.m.), there is progression of opacification of the right lung, with
 only a small partially aerated portion of the lung seen in the upper zone. 
 There may be some volume loss on the right, though this is difficult to
 confirm, due to rotation.  The left lung is grossly clear, with resolution of
 previously seen left base opacity.  No left-sided CHF, focal infiltrate, or
 effusion is identified at this time.Clips noted over lower mediastinum. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  Considerable interval increase in the degree of opacification of
 the right lung.  This may represent a combination of pleural fluid and
 collapse and/or consolidation.  Given the rapid change, is there reason to
 suspect mucous plugging?

 HISTORY:  Acute-on-chronic shortness of breath, _____ diastolic CHF, known
 metastatic leiomyosarcoma, CAD status post CABG, question pneumonia, pulmonary
 edema.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Rotated positioning.  The patient is status post sternotomy, with
 cardiomegaly.  There is upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular
 blurring, consistent with CHF.  The left hemidiaphragm is elevated, likely
 accentuated by what appears to be air within the fundus, dilating the gastric
 fundus.  Aside from some increased retrocardiac density, no frank
 consolidation or gross effusion is identified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  CHF with upper zone redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring.
 Minimal left lower lobe opacity also noted.  Of note, the chest CT from
 ___ described innumerable pulmonary nodules.  It would be difficult to
 distinguish interstitial metastatic disease from the findings on the current
 study, but the upper zone redistribution and overall blurring does appear more
 pronounced than on ___ and that rapid change supports the diagnosis of CHF.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Respiratory failure, evaluation.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___, 0:51 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the monitoring and support
 devices are unchanged.  The lung volumes have increased, likely reflecting
 increased ventilatory pressure.  The pre-existing combination of a right
 parenchymal opacity and diffusion has decreased in extent and severity.  The
 retrocardiac lung parenchyma has also slightly increased in transparency.  No
 evidence of new parenchymal opacities.  A left pleural effusion is not
 present.  In the left perihilar areas, there is minimal peribronchial cuffing
 and an increase in diameter of the vascular structures, so that mild pulmonary
 edema cannot be excluded.

 New feeding tube, without a wire stylet, ends in the mid esophagus just below
 the level of the carina.  Moderate-to-large right pleural effusion is probably
 increased in volume, but comparison is difficult because patient is supine on
 this study, erect on the earlier study today.  Consolidation at both lung
 bases is probably due to worsening atelectasis but of course pneumonia and
 large scale aspiration are not excluded.  Patient is rotated to her left which
 distorts the cardiac silhouette, probably mildly enlarged but unchanged.  The
 left rib fractures are in various stages of healing.  Thoracic aorta is
 tortuous and heavily calcified.  No pneumothorax.  Dr. ___ ___ I
 discussed these findings by telephone at the time of dictation.

 FINDINGS:  Single semi-erect portable view of the chest was obtained.  Opacity
 projecting over the right mid to lower lung is likely due to pleural effusion
 with overlying atelectasis, underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  If
 want to know full extent of pleural effusion, consider decubitus views.  There
 is a nodular opacity projecting over the lateral right lower hemithorax, most
 likely representing nipple shadow, although attention at followup once pleural
 effusion resolved is suggested.  There is a small left pleural effusion.  The
 cardiac silhouette is top normal to mildly enlarged.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of lethargy.
 
 COMPARISON:  None.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  The
 patient is rotated to the left.  Large area of opacification involving the
 right mid to lower lung suggests pleural effusion with overlying atelectasis,
 underlying consolidation cannot be excluded.  There is also blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle which may be due to pleural effusion.  The left
 retrocardiac opacity and obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm is seen, may be
 due to pleural effusion and atelectasis although underlying consolidation not
 excluded.  The cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are shifted leftward of
 midline presumably due to patient positioning/rotation.  Suggest repeat with
 better positioning when patient able.

 been removed.  No pneumothorax is identified.  Again noted is a right IJ
 sheath over the proximal-most SVC and a right subclavian central line with tip
 in region of SVC-RA junction, unchanged.
 
 Allowing for low inspiratory volumes, the cardiomediastinal silhouette is
 probably unchanged.  Left base collapse and/or consolidation is stable.Small
 left pleural effusion is unchanged.   There is also some increased opacity at
 the right base, with a small right effusion, which may be slightly worse. 
 There is upper zone redistribution.  I doubt overt CHF.

 CHEST, SINGLE AP VIEW, LORDOTIC POSITIONING.
 
 A left-sided chest tube is present. There is subcutaneous emphysema along the
 left chest wall. Left mediastinal surgical clips again noted.
 
 There is probable small pneumothorax at left lung apex.  There is retrocardiac
 density with obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm, increased compared with
 the prior stidy. This likely represents a combination of elevated left
 hemidiaphragm, left lower lobe collapse/consolidation, and a small left
 effusion.  The right lung is grossly clear, without pneumothorax, frank
 consolidation or gross effusion.  Minimal linear atelectasis in the right mid
 zone is noted.   There s possible minimal upper zone redistribution, but I
 doubt overt CHF.
 
 Compared with ___ at 14:13 p.m., the ET tube has been removed.  The tiny
 left pneumothorax is new or better seen.  The opacification at the left base
 is new.  
 
 Findnigs were discussed with Dr. ___ at approximately 1:40 pm on

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made with chest radiograph from ___,
 ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral images of the chest demonstrate interval worsening
 of left lung opacity.  The entire left hemithorax is now again opacified. 
 Opacification is likely due to a large left pleural fluid collection in the
 setting of lobectomy versus less likely left lung collapse.  There is
 persistent significant elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.  The right lung is
 clear.  There is no right pleural effusion.  Cardiac size cannot be assessed
 due to obscuration by the left hemithorax opacification.  The mediastinum is
 not shifted.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval increase in the opacification of left hemithorax, likely
 consistent with large left pleural effusion.  Right lung is clear.

 same day (7:29 a.m.), the small left apical pneumothorax is again noted,
 itself unchanged.  However, on the current exam, air is noted along the medial
 surface of the left lung.  This may represent a portion of the apical
 pneumothorax that is dissecting medially or, alternatively, a small 
 pneumomediastinum.  In retrospect, this may have been present on the earlier
 film, but is better seen on the current exam due to increased contrast.  It
 was not clearly present on ___ film. Again seen is subcutaneous emphysema,
 which appears bmore pronounced.
 
 Opacity at the left base shows some interval improvement, with the elevated
 left hemidiaphragm now better defined.  Some residual atelectasis and/or
 consolidation and residual pleural fluid  are likely present.

 HISTORY:  ___-year-old male with metastatic lung cancer presenting with chronic
 cough and failure to thrive.
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exams performed ___, ___, and ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest demonstrate interval
 increase in opacification of the left chest, with interval increase in left
 hemidiaphragmatic elevation likely the result of phrenic nerve paralysis. 
 There is minimal residual aerated left lung in this patient who is status post
 left upper lobectomy.  The right lung is hyperexpanded and clear.  The cardiac
 silhouette is not well assessed.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Collapse of the remaining left lung with further elevation of a
 probably paralyzed left hemidiaphragm.  Further evaluation with CT would
 provide a better evaluation of the airways and for the etiology of lung
 collapse.
 
 These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ ___ the MICU at 10am by phone.

 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Compared with earlier on the same day (9:35 a.m.), there has been progressive
 opacification of the left lung, with only a small residual lucent focus (~2.7
 x 2.0 cm) at the left lung apex.  As before, there is evidence that the left
 hemidiaphragm is elevated, but now the mid portion of the lung is also
 opacified.  There is slight leftward deviation of the trachea, new compared
 with ___ at 7:29 a.m. Otherwise, the mediastinum remains midline.
 
 The lucency at the left lung apex may represent either a small amount of
 aerated lung or a small loculated ptx.  No definite medial ptx component or
 penumomediastinum. However, the lateral edge of the descending aorta remains
 faintly visible.   Subcutaneous emphysema again noted, slightly improved. Left
 chest tube again noted, unchanged.
 
 There is a slightly displaced fracture or osteotomy of the left ___ posterior
 rib. In retrospect, this has been present since ___, but appears slightly
 more displaced on this study.
 
 The right lung shows mild vascular plethora, without overt CHF.  Probable
 minimal atelectasis at the right lung base.  However, the right lung remains
 grossly clear. 
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1) Rapid progressive opacification of the left upper and mid lung, with
 evidence of volume loss and persistent left hemidiaphragm elevation.  Clinical
 correlation is requested in this patient status post left lobectomy.  
 
 2) Difficult to determine whether a small pneumothorax or small amount of
 pneumomediastinum is still present. No fluid level detected to suggest 
 hyrdropneumothorax.
 
 3) Slightly displaced left posterior 6th rib fracture or osteotomy. Note is
 made that the patient is s/p thoracotomy.
 
 4) Right lung clear except for mild vascular plethora and minimal basilar
 atelectasis.

 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST
 
 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess for pneumothorax after chest tube removal.
 
 Comparison is made with prior study performed the same day earlier in the
 morning.  
 
 There has been interval worsening in opacification in the left hemithorax;
 this is consistent with increasing atelectasis of the remaining upper lobe and
 increasing pleural effusion.  In the right lung, there are atelectasis in the
 lower lobe.  Left IJ catheter is in unchanged standard position.  Left chest
 wall subcutaneous emphysema has also improved.  Cardiomediastinal structures
 are midline partially excluded by the pleural parenchymal abnormalities on the
 left. 
 There is left apical pneumothorax probably unchanged.

 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy and CABG.  Evaluation of the cardiac silhouette size is difficult
 due to the presence of a chronic, moderate-to-large left pleural effusion,
 which appears slightly increased in size when compared to prior study.  There
 is persistent left basilar opacification, likely reflecting compressive
 atelectasis.  The right lung demonstrates mild atelectasis at the lung base,
 but is otherwise clear.  No pneumothorax is identified.  There is no pulmonary
 vascular congestion.  The aorta remains tortuous and calcified.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Moderate-to-large chronic left pleural effusion, slightly
 increased compared to the prior study with persistent left basilar
 opacification, likely reflecting compressive atelectasis, though infection
 cannot be completely excluded.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Sternotomy wires are unchanged.  The heart and mediastinal contours
 are within normal limits and stable.  There has been interval decrease in a
 left-sided pleural effusion with some persisting left basilar atelectasis. 
 The right lung is clear.  A line between the posterior aspects of the left
 third and fourth rib space is more compatible with a skin fold rather than the
 visceral pleura of the lung, so pneumothorax is not favored.  However, given
 the recent instrumentation, if growing clinical concern for pneumothorax
 exists, short-interval followup may be considered.

 FINDINGS:  Single portable AP radiograph was provided.
 
 There is increased opacity at the right base which may be due to infectious
 process or aspiration. Rounded density projecting over the right ninth
 posterior rib is likely a nipple shadow and can be followed on subsequent
 radiographs. A chronic moderate-sized left pleural effusion is similar in
 appearance to the prior study.  Overlying opacities are likely atelectasis.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Hypoxia, hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Triple-lead left-sided AICD is again seen with leads extending to
 the expected position of the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary
 sinus.  The lead extending to the coronary sinus, the distal aspect of which
 is partially obscured by the overlying battery pack.  There are extremely low
 lung volumes that accentuate the bronchovascular markings.  The left lung base
 is obscured by patient's overlying battery packs and not well evaluated. 
 Right basilar atelectasis is seen.  There is blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle, which may be due to small pleural effusion.  Aortic knob
 calcification is again seen.  The cardiac silhouette is grossly stable.  There
 is gaseous distention of the stomach and possibly the colon.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Suboptimal evaluation of the left mid to lower lung due to
 overlying battery pack.  If this is areas of high clinical concern, consider
 repeat with re-positioning of the patient.  There are extremely low lung
 volumes.  Right basilar atelectasis is seen.  Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle could be due to small pleural effusion.  
 
 Gaseous distention of the stomach and possibly of the bowel.

 AP radiograph of the chest 
 
 Heart size and mediastinum are grossly stable.  Interval increase in right
 pleural effusion is suspected, although in part it may be related to different
 character of that study being semi-erect as opposite to portable study on the
 prior examination as well as more symmetric and not rotated image acquisition.
 Left retrocardiac opacity might reflect area of atelectasis, slightly worse
 since prior examination.  It also might be due to large hiatal hernia. 
 Infectious process, developing in this location would be another possibility.

 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 7:43 a.m.
 
 A left IJ Swan-Ganz catheter is present.  As before, the tip lies relatively
 distal in the right pulmonary artery.  Clinical correlation to assess for
 possible retraction is requested.  A mesh-like stent extends along the
 expected course of the left subclavian and brachiocephalic vessels.  
 
 Compared with the earlier film, there may have been slight interval
 improvement in the upper zone redistribution and vascular engorgement. 
 Otherwise, no gross interval change is detected. 
 
 Again seen is mild vascular prominence and opacity at the right base which is
 likely a combination of pleural fluid, possible elevated hemidiaphragm, and
 underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  There is also increased
 retrocardiac density, consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation and a small left effusion.  The left effusion is slightly more
 apparent on the current exam.  No pneumothorax is detected.

 A portable AP upright chest film, ___ at 10:51 is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  The Dobbhoff feeding tube is seen coursing down into the stomach and then
 courses back up into the upper esophagus where the tip is positioned.  Removal
 with an attempt at repositioning of the Dobbhoff feeding tube would be advised
 at this time.  The endotracheal tube remains in place and the tip is difficult
 to identify as this is the location where the Dobbhoff feeding tube appears to
 be coiled within the esophagus.  However, it is likely unchanged in position. 
 There has been median sternotomy.  Stable postoperative cardiac and
 mediastinal contours.  There are layering effusions bilaterally with some
 associated patchy airspace disease, which most likely represents compressive
 atelectasis.  Overall, there has been interval improvement in the pulmonary
 edema.  No pneumothorax is seen.  Results of this examination were conveyed
 directly to the patient's nurse, ___, on ___ at 11:55 a.m.  The
 patient's nurse stated that the feeding tube has already been withdrawn and a
 new feeding tube has been put in place.

 CHEST PORTABLE
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old man with cardiac arrest, now status post Tandem heart
 transplant, intubation, multiple line placement.  Chest x-ray to evaluate for
 lines and tubes.
 
 CHEST PORTABLE:  Comparison is made to prior examination of ___.  The lung
 volumes are low.  The heart size is therefore likely adequate.  There is some
 widening of the mediastinum although again this is likely due to poor
 inspiratory effort.  There is hazy opacity and vascular haziness in both lungs
 consistent with interstitial edema.  An ET tube is identified 3.2 cm from the
 carina in correct position.  A pacemaker lead in the right ventricle and a
 second lead in the right atrium.  There is a subclavian line with its tip in
 the distal SVC.  An NG tube is noted coursing through the esophagus into the
 stomach.  The tip of the NG tube is not identified on this film.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Tubes and lines in adequate position as described above. 
 2.  Pulmonary edema involving both lungs.
 3.  Widening of the mediastinum and possible cardiomegaly are likely due to
 low lung volumes.

 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, bilateral pleural effusions
 of mild-to-moderate extent, left more than right, have newly appeared.
 
 Bilaterally, these leads through mild basal areas of atelectasis.  Overall,
 the lung volumes have decreased.  The tracheostomy tube, the nasogastric tube
 and the ECG leads are constant.  On the right, the pre-existing right internal
 jugular vein catheter in the subclavian catheter has been replaced by a
 right-sided PICC line.  The tip of the PICC line projects over the
 mid-to-lower SVC.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.

 COMPARISON:  Radiograph of one day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  Swan-Ganz catheter has been advanced to the region of the right
 ventricular outflow tract.  Other indwelling devices are unchanged in
 position.  Cardiac silhouette has slightly decreased in size and pulmonary
 edema has improved with mild residual interstitial edema remaining as well as
 a small right effusion.  Bilateral chest tubes remain in place, with no
 visible pleural line to suggest pneumothorax.  However, slightly deep left
 costophrenic sulcus associated with lucency in this region could potentially
 represent a basilar pneumothorax on this supine radiograph.

 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 An ET tube is present -- the tip lies approximately 2.9 cm above the carina. 
 Right subclavian central line tip overlies the SVC/RA junction.  No
 pneumothorax is detected.  
 
 Status post sternotomy, with prosthetic valve and multiple clips in the
 mediastinum, near the thoracic inlet, and in the upper abdomen.  Unusual
 density overlying the gastric fundus may represent some residual oral contrast
 within the stomach.  Attention to this area on followup films is requested.  
 
 There are bilateral effusions, with some underlying atelectasis.  Retrocardiac
 opacity is consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation. 
 Upper zone redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring likely reflects
 CHF.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1)  Interval placement of the ET tube, tip in satisfactory position above the
 carina.  Otherwise, overall similar.
 2)  Radiopacity over stomach - ? residual contrast. Clinical correlation
 requested.
 3) LLL collpase consolidation. 
 4) Bilateral effusions.

 present, tip extending beneath diaphragm,  off film.  ET tube in satisfactory
 position approximately 5.5 cm above the carina.   Right subclavian central
 line tip over distal SVC.  
 
 Cardiomediastinal silhouette appears smaller.  Sternotomy wires and prosthetic
 valve noted.  There is CHF with interstitial edema.  Allowing for technical
 differences, this is fairly similar to the most recent prior film.  There is a
 small-to-moderate left effusion, with underlying collapse and/or
 consolidation.  Hazy density at the right base also likely reflects layering
 effusion, with some underlying atelectasis.

 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female with likely pneumonia at outside hospital.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Single AP view of the chest.  Postoperative changes again seen in the right
 thoracic cavity.  Compared to prior, there appears to be less aerated lung on
 the right which could be due to enlarging effusion with possible underlying
 parenchymal abnormality.  In addition, there is persistent left basilar
 opacity not significantly changed given differences in technique.  Superiorly,
 the left lung remains clear.  Right PICC and right pleural catheter are again
 noted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Persistent left basilar opacity, compared to ___.  This could
 represent atelectasis although infection is not excluded.  
 
 2.  Less aerated lung on the right when compared to prior, potentially due to
 collecting pleural fluid although developing parenchymal abnormalities are
 also possible.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 A generalized increase in opacification of the lower lungs accompanied by
 persistence of previous acute enlargement of the heart suggests much of the
 interval change over the past four days is due to worsening pulmonary edema
 and pleural effusions, moderate on both sides.  Given those findings, early
 pneumonia would be difficult to detect, but does not have to be invoked to
 explain the changes we see.
 
 Patient has had right upper thoracoplasty with rib resections, in association
 with the described lobectomy.

 HISTORY:  Postoperative, to assess for change.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been substantial
 improvement in the degree of pulmonary edema with only mild residual elevation
 of pulmonary venous pressure.  Persistent opacification at the bases is
 consistent with pleural effusion and volume loss, especially in the
 retrocardiac region.

 HISTORY:  Rib fracture with worsening hypoxia, to assess for pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is slightly less
 opacification at the left base.  This is most consistent with atelectasis and
 effusion, though in the appropriate clinical setting, supervening pneumonia
 would have to be considered.  Specifically, no evidence of pneumothorax.  No
 acute focal pneumonia.

 HISTORY:  Post-trauma.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there has been development of
 diffuse bilateral pulmonary opacifications with widening of the vascular
 pedicle.  In view of the injury to the manubrium, this most likely represents
 congestive failure, possibly exacerbated by large amounts of fluid
 replacement.  Bilateral pleural effusions are seen with compressive
 atelectasis at the bases.
 
 In view of the multiple traumas, the possibility of fat embolism syndrome
 would have to be considered if diuretic therapy is insufficient to cause
 clearing of the radiographic findings.

 HISTORY:  ___-year-old female status post MVCR with multiple rib fractures and
 manubrium fracture.  Evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  CT torso from ___ and chest radiograph from
 ___.
 
 SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE FRONTAL CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Minimally displaced right-sided
 rib fractures appear similar compared to prior trauma radiographs from
 ___ and are better characterized on followup CT torso from the
 same day.  Known left-sided rib fractures are also better characterized on
 prior CT.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  Linear opacities in the lung
 bases correspond with known subsegmental atelectasis including increased left
 basilar opacity since the prior radiographs.  The left upper lung appears
 better aerated, however.  New mild blunting of the bilateral costophrenic
 angles suggestive of developing small bilateral pleural effusions.  A known
 manubrium fracture is not well characterized on this single frontal view. 
 Mediastinal contours appear similar compared to recent prior suggesting
 probable stability of the known retrosternal hematoma. Hilar and cardiac
 contours are within normal limits.  Cervical spinal hardware is incompletely
 imaged.  There has been interval placement of probable epidural catheter in
 the mid thoracic spine.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Unchanged multiple rib fractures, better characterized on prior CT.  No
 pneumothorax.
 
 2.  Stable mediastinal contours, though incompletely evaluated manubrial
 fracture and retrosternal hematoma.
 
 3.  New left basilar opacity suggesting atelectasis.
 
 4.  Suspected very small developing pleural effusions.

 INDICATION:  Shortness of breath and intubated.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Single frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior examinations, most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is marked scoliosis with convexity to the right, similar to
 prior examinations and with increased patient rotation to the right.  In the
 interval from the prior examination, obscuration of the left hemidiaphragm may
 be due to pleural effusion and atelectasis, though a consolidation or
 pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  There may be mild interstitial edema. 
 Patchy right lower lobe opacity may be due to infection or aspiration.  No
 pneumothorax is seen.  The heart is mildly enlarged.
 
 An endotracheal tube is in standard position with tip near the inferior margin
 of the clavicular heads.  An esophageal catheter has been placed, coursing
 inferior to the diaphragm with side port within the stomach and tip out of
 view of the radiograph.  A left-sided dual-lead pacemaker is in standard
 position.

 COMPARISON:  ___ chest x-ray.
 
 FINDINGS:  Nasogastric tube terminates in the proximal stomach.  Cardiac
 silhouette remains enlarged, and aorta is tortuous and calcified.  Left

 HISTORY:  Intubated ___-year-old patient.
 
 Perihilar opacification in the left lung which developed between ___
 and ___ has improved, probably resolving pneumonia.  Lung volumes
 remain quite low, but discrete atelectasis in the left lower lobe is not as
 pronounced today as it was on ___.  Heart is moderately enlarged and
 the thoracic aorta is generally dilated and heavily calcified, but not acutely
 changed.  ET tube and right internal jugular line are in standard placements
 and transvenous right atrial and right ventricular pacer leads are unchanged
 in their positions following their expected courses.  Nasogastric tube ends in
 the distal stomach.  No pneumothorax.

 HISTORY:  ET tube placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the tip of the endotracheal
 tube now measures approximately 2.5 cm above the carina.  Other monitoring and
 support devices are essentially unchanged.  The left hemidiaphragm is again
 poorly seen, consistent with volume loss in the lower lobe with probable
 effusion.  This latter observation is supported by haziness of the left
 hemithorax, consistent with layering fluid.  The right lung is essentially
 clear.  Overall, cardiac size remains enlarged.  Poor definition of pulmonary
 vessels is consistent with increased pulmonary venous pressure.

 INDICATION:  ___-year-old woman with a history of CAD, CHF with chest pain,
 evaluate for pneumonia or effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest demonstrate well-expanded lungs. 
 In comparison to the prior study, there is interval obscuration of the right
 heart border and the medial right hemidiaphragm. Correlation with the lateral
 view suggests that this is likely due to interval development of small
 bilateral pleural effusions. Underlying consolidation is not excluded. No
 pneumothorax.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette is otherwise stable. 
 
 Of note, an air fluid level in a tubular structure posterior to the trachea on
 the lateral view is consistent with a dilated fluid-filled esophagus.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Interval development of small bilateral pleural effusions. Underlying
 consolidation not excluded. 
 
 2.  Dilated fluid-filled esophagus.

 INDICATION:  Hypoxia.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, portable AP upright.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 There is a new asymmetric perihilar opacification of the right mid lung.  This
 is superimposed on moderate bilateral pleural effusions, similar to increased
 on the right and perhaps somewhat decreased on the left. Increased
 opacification at the right lung base may also reflect increasing atelectasis
 associated with a pleural effusion, although an area of infection is not
 excluded. Pulmonary vessels show upper zone redistribution and Kerley lines
 are present suggesting coinciding mild congestive heart failure but generally
 similar in extent.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 New large area of focal right perihilar opacification, superimposed on pleural
 effusions as well as findings associated with mild pulmonary edema.  The
 asymmetry suggests superimposed pneumonia as the etiology, or perhaps
 aspiration in the appropriate clinical setting; alternatively asymmetric
 pulmonary edema could be considered.  Short-term follow-up radiographs may be
 helpful to reassess.

 FINDINGS:  No previous images.  There is hyperexpansion of the lungs
 suggestive of chronic pulmonary disease.  Prominence of engorged and
 ill-defined pulmonary vessels is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of
 pulmonary vascular congestion, though in the absence of previous images it is
 difficult to determine whether any this appearance could reflect underlying
 chronic pulmonary disease.  The possibility of supervening consolidation would
 be impossible to exclude on this single study, especially without a lateral
 view.

 esophagectomy and gastric pull-through.  Chronic scarring within the medial
 aspect of the right upper lobe is compatible with post radiation changes. 
 Tenting of the right hemidiaphragm is compatible chronic volume loss in the
 right lung. Worsening opacification within the right upper lobe is concerning
 for recurrent pneumonia or aspiration.  8 mm nodular opacity within the right
 lower lobe is unchanged.  The left lung is clear.   Blunting of the right
 costophrenic angle is chronic, and likely reflects a chronic small pleural
 effusion.  No pneumothorax.  No acute osseous abnormalities demonstrated.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1. Worsening opacification within the right upper lobe which is concerning for
 recurrent pneumonia or aspiration.  Follow up radiographs are recommended
 after treatment to ensure resolution of this finding.  
 
 2. Status post esophagectomy and gastric pull-through with right upper lobe
 medial scarring related to prior radiation treatment.
 
 3. Unchanged 8 mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule.

 CHEST, TWO VIEWS.
 
 There is background hyperinflation consistent with COPD.  The right
 hemidiaphragm is elevated, with blunting of the right costophrenic angle and
 diffuse hazy opacity in the right lung -- allowing for differences in
 technique, this is likely unchanged compared with earlier the same day. 
 Probable bulla in the right perihilar region.  Minimal atelectasis or scarring
 at the left lung base.  The left lung is appears prominently hyperlucent --
 overall, allowing for technical differences, the appearance is similar to
 ___ on the left and this appearance may be accentuated by opacity on the
 right side.  
 
 Subclavian catheter terminates in the region of the SVC/RA junction.  No
 pneumothorax detected.Incompletely imaged thoracic spinal stabilization
 hardware noted.  
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small right effusion and hazy opacity in right lung, with right
 base collapse and/or consolidation.

 HISTORY:  A ___-year-old woman with pericardial effusion.  Evaluate for cardiac
 size.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 The patient is rotated to the right.  Nevertheless, there is no appreciable
 cardiomegaly.  Lungs are grossly clear, and pleural effusions are minimal, if
 any.  Caliber of the mediastinum is difficult to assess, however, because of
 rotation.  There could be distention of the azygos and other mediastinal
 veins.  If that determination is important to make regarding the presence of
 pericardial effusion, then a repeat film should be obtained with careful
 attention to proper positioning.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Frontal and lateral radiographs of chest were reviewed in
 comparison with prior radiographs from ___ to ___. 
 Concurrently a chest CT from ___ was also reviewed.
 
 FINDINGS:  Diffuse interstitial opacities, predominantly in the right lung
 base and probably very mild in the left lung base are present.  When compared
 to the prior chest CT from ___, these interstitial opacities
 appear new, and given the clinical history, likely represent lung infection
 (atypical viral) or asymmetric pulmonary edema.  In view of history, a
 possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis also needs to be ruled out. 
 Compared with prior radiograph from ___, a dense opacity in the
 left perihilar region, likely radiation fibrosis has significantly improved
 over ___ to ___, as demonstrated on series of chest CT's . 
 Heart size is mildly larger and unchanged.  Irregularity of the hilar and
 mediastinal border is likely postradiation.  Ill-defined opacity in the left
 mid lung corresponds to scarring and atelectasis, as suggested on review of
 chest CT from ___.  Pleural effusion, if any, is minimal
 bilaterally.  Bilateral lower lung bases are remarkable for mild atelectasis.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Diffuse interstitial opacities in the right lung and very mild in left
 lung base, in view of history most likely reflect lung infection or asymmetric
 pulmonary edema.  A possibility of lymphangitic spread of malignancy also
 needs to be ruled out in view of clinical history.
 
 2.  Irregularity of the mediastinal and hilar contours is attributed to the
 postradiation changes.

 Diffuse infiltrative pulmonary abnormality in the right lung has not improved
 since ___, after worsening between ___ and ___. 
 Left lung has been relatively spared, though transiently developed a diffuse
 interstitial abnormality on the ___ before resolving the same day.  There is
 certainly a component of recoverable pulmonary edema, but the right lung
 abnormality raises concern for conditions such as pulmonary drug reaction,

 FINDINGS:  Again seen are chronic interstitial changes predominantly in the
 right lower and left mid and lower lungs.  However, there is increased density
 of opacification in the right lower hemithorax concerning for developing
 infection.  Considerations include atypical infection, though asymmetric
 pulmonary edema is possible.  Given history of lung malignancy, lymphangitic
 carcinomatosis is also a consideration.  Underlying fibrotic changes are
 grossly similar with predominantly paramediastinal and lingular distribution.

 enlarged, however, unchanged.  Of note, on the CT of ___, there
 was a small pericardial effusion.  There are atherosclerotic calcifications of
 the aortic arch.

 HISTORY:  Hypotension and acidosis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The study is somewhat limited secondary to positioning.  The
 patient is markedly rotated.  Again seen is a large-bore dual-lumen catheter
 from a left subclavian approach.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is
 again evident and slightly exaggerated.  There is engorgement of the vascular
 pedicle and cephalization of the pulmonary vascularity, which is likely at
 least in part due to the supine positioning.  Linear atelectasis is seen in
 the retrocardiac left lower lobe.  No focal consolidation is seen.  The
 mediastinum again demonstrates a tortuous aorta exaggerated by the rotation. 
 Likewise, the cardiac silhouette is stable, but exaggerated.  No large
 effusion is noted.  Blunting of the right costophrenic angle is relatively
 stable.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Limited study, but overall grossly stable.  The slight
 engorgement is noted principally in the left hilar region may be in part due
 to recumbency.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 supine position.  Comparison is made with a previous similar examination of
 ___, which also was performed with the patient in supine position. 
 Moderate cardiac enlargement as before.  Heart size may have increased
 slightly.  However, portable technique in supine position does not allow
 precise assessment.  Comparison with the next previous study clearly
 identifies a new parenchymal density in the left hemithorax in perihilar
 position extending into the left upper lobe.  The previously identified left
 lower lobe linear densities suspicious for atelectasis persist.  No new
 pulmonary abnormalities in the right hemithorax and no pneumothorax identified
 on either side.  The patient is intubated and the ETT terminates in the
 trachea some 5 cm above the level of the carina.
 
 IMPRESSION:  New parenchymal infiltrates in mid and left upper lung field.  As
 patient apparently was in supine position during the last ten days, consider
 possibility of aspiration pneumonitis in this unusual location.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The lungs appear hyperexpanded.  There is mild increased pulmonary
 vascular congestion from ___.  A small right pleural effusion is likely
 present with mild right basilar atelectasis. Right base consolidation is not
 entirely excluded. No significant left pleural effusion or pneumothorax is
 detected.  Suture chain material and scarring in the left upper-to-mid lung
 zone is not significantly changed.  Multiple mediastinal surgical clips are
 compatible with history of CABG surgery.  The cardiac silhouette is top normal

 The study of ___, the Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed and there is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  Continued substantial enlargement of the cardiac
 silhouette with pulmonary vascular congestion that appears to be decreasing. 
 The hazy opacification at the right base has substantially cleared and the
 hemidiaphragm is more sharply seen.  This could represent improved pleural
 effusion, though it could merely be a manifestation of a more erect position
 of the patient.  Poor definition of the right heart border with basilar
 opacification is again consistent with substantial volume loss in the right
 middle and lower lobe.

 HISTORY:  Rule out pneumothorax after thoracentesis.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP upright chest radiograph shows improved aeration at the
 right lung base, presumably status post right-sided thoracentesis.  No
 pneumothorax is visible.  The left hemidiaphragm remains obscured and there
 appears to be increased haziness of the mid and upper lung zone compared to
 the study from eight hours earlier.  Some of this may be exaggerated because
 of increased rotation.  Left-sided PICC line tubing may be slightly pulled
 back and now is at the level of the mid superior vena cava.

 the right).

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAMINATION:  CHEST (PORTABLE AP)
 
 INDICATION:  ___M s/p PEA and now s/p extubation w/tachypnea  // interval
 changes      interval changes
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 In comparison with the study of earlier in this date, the endotracheal tube
 has been removed, as has the nasogastric tube.  Continued enlargement of the
 cardiac silhouette with some element of elevated pulmonary venous pressure. 
 Opacification at the right base is consistent with collapse in the right
 middle and lower lobe with possible pleural effusion.  Less prominent left
 basilar opacification is consistent with some volume loss in the left lower
 lobe and probable small effusion.

 FINDINGS:
 There is little change since ___. A right subclavian approach port tip
 remains in the lower SVC. two chest tubes overlie the right base with lucency
 demonstrated about one, which may represent a small basilar pneumothorax.
 
 There is a moderate right pleural effusion with pleural fluid demonstrated
 layering along the apex and also demonstrated along medially adjacent to the
 mediastinum.  There is persistent asymmetric opacification with increased
 asymmetric pulmonary vascularity involving the right lung.  There is moderate
 right lower lobe atelectasis and minimal left basilar atelectasis.  There is
 no evidence of pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
 stable.  A calcified lymph node is demonstrated in the region of the

 AP CHEST, 12:34 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Acute onset of stridor, assess airway.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Unfortunately the region of the larynx where one would look for a cause of
 stridor, is not included on this study.  There is a suggestion of narrowing of
 the airway, but that can be a normal finding in an elderly patient.  Lungs are
 clear.  Heart size is normal.  There is mild widening of the mediastinum which
 could be due to venous engorgement, and a vertically oriented air collection
 projecting to the left of the trachea along the aortic arch could be a swallow
 in the esophagus, however given concern about esophageal perforation, CT
 scanning is indicated to exclude air and fluid in the mediastinum.
 
 Dr. ___ ___ I discussed this case by telephone at the time of dictation.

 a.m.:
 
 Tip of the endotracheal tube is just at the thoracic inlet with the chin
 flexed, no less than 6 cm from the carina.  To avoid inadvertent extubation
 with extension of the neck it should be advanced 2 to 3 cm for more secured
 seating.  Enteric tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Right jugular
 line ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax.  Right lower lobe is now
 completely collapsed.  There may be developing consolidation at the left lung
 base.  Followup recommended for possible pneumonia.  At least a small right
 pleural effusion is presumed.  Lucency outlining the left mediastinal contour
 from the aortic knob to the hilus has been present since chest radiographs ___, presumably represents paraseptal emphysema.

 HISTORY:  Shortness of breath and wheezing, to assess for fluid overload.
 
 FINDINGS  In comparison with the study of ___, there is little overall
 change.  Elevation of the right hemidiaphragm is again seen.  Cardiac
 silhouette is within normal limits.  There is some prominence of the central
 pulmonary vessels on the right, possibly relating to pulmonary artery
 hypertension.  No evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion or pleural
 effusion.  Mild retrocardiac opacification most likely represents atelectasis.

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Patient intubated.  Evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___
 
 FINDINGS:  A frontal semi-upright view of the chest was obtained portably. The
 endotracheal tube ends at the level of the inferior clavicular heads and is no
 less than 5.2cm above the carina.  The nasogastric tube follows the expected
 course, although the tip is not visualized.  
 
 Low lung volumes result in bronchovascular crowding.  New opacification of
 both lower lobes despite no change in lung volumes compared to the prior study
 is concerning for pneuomonia. The upper lung zones are clear.  There is no
 large pleural effusion or pneumothorax, although the left lung apex is
 obscured by the chin. The azygous vein is bigger than before with increased
 caliber of the left upper lobe vessels. The right hilus is chronically
 enlarged. Cardiac silhouette is stable. Flattening of the right humeral head
 may be due to avascular necrosis. Degenerative change is seen in the left
 shoulder girdle.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Endotracheal tube is no less than 5.2cm above the carina.  Given that the
 patient's chin is down on the radiograph, the ETT could be advanced 2-3cm for
 better seating.
 2.  Bilateral lower lobe opacification, concerning for pneumonia.
 3.  Mild congestive heart failure.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 INDICATION:  Polytrauma.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the pre-existing mild
 interstitial fluid overload has decreased.  Unchanged are the retrocardiac
 areas of atelectasis, the large perihilar right-sided opacity as well as the
 likely presence of bilateral small pleural effusions.  The monitoring and
 support devices are constant.  The known rib fractures are better appreciated
 on the CT examination from ___.  No evidence of pneumothorax.

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Suspected hemothorax.
 
 AP radiograph of the chest was compared to ___.
 
 The Dobbhoff tube has been inserted, currently following appropriate course.
 
 The left perihilar mass noted on the prior study is now associated with
 widespread opacities surrounding it, which may reflect bleeding or aspiration
 or interval development of infection.  Bilateral pleural effusions have
 developed in the interim, small.  No change in the right rib fractures is
 demonstrated, better assessed on the current study.  Retrocardiac atelectasis
 has progressed in the interim.
 
 Given the multiple attempts to adjust the Dobbhoff tube, the bibasilar
 opacities and the left perihilar opacity may reflect aspiration, but
 infectious process cannot be excluded and should be closely followed.

 post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ at 20:22.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP erect portable view of the chest was obtained.  There has
 been interval placement of a left-sided chest tube which appears to terminate
 approximately at the level of the medial left diaphragm and may extend to the
 mediastinum.  There has been re-expansion of the left lung with opacity in the
 left mid-to-lower lung which could be due to pulmonary hemorrhage/contusion,
 partial collapse, or less likely infection.  Subcutaneous emphysema is seen
 along the left chest wall.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of left chest tube with reexpansion of the
 left lung, with opacity/consolidation in the left mid-to-lower lung fields
 with shift of the mediastinum to the left may be due to partial lung collapse,

 HISTORY:  Dyspnea, to evaluate for pleural effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, there is continued
 enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with vascular congestion and large
 pleural effusions, more prominent on the left with underlying substantial
 compressive atelectasis.  Dual-channel dialysis catheter remains in place. 
 There has been insertion of a left subclavian catheter.  The tip of this is
 difficult to evaluate because it is superimposed on the dialysis catheter.  It
 definitely extends at least to the lower portion of the SVC.  To more
 precisely demonstrate the tip of this catheter, oblique views would be
 necessary.

 HISTORY:  Fever and altered mental status.  The patient is on dialysis.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Consistent with the given history, large-bore dual-lumen dialysis
 catheter from a right internal jugular approach is in stable and standard
 course and position from a right internal jugular approach.  A left internal
 jugular central venous catheter device has been removed in the interval.  No
 consolidation or edema is evident.  The mediastinum is unremarkable.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged.  This is an interval change compared to the
 most recent prior study but has been noted on other prior studies.  Subtle
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle suggests a tiny effusion.  No
 pneumothorax is evident.  There are no displaced fractures.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Small bilateral pleural effusions.  Interval marked enlargement
 of the cardiac silhouette relative to the most recent prior exam.  However,
 other more remote exams have demonstrated enlargement of the silhouette,
 thereby suggesting the possibility of waxing and waning pericardial effusion. 
 Correlate clinically.

 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.
 
 Lungs are hyperinflated, consistent with COPD.  There is cardiomegaly.  The
 patient is status post sternotomy, with prosthetic valve.  There is upper zone
 redistribution and diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with CHF.  There is a
 moderate to moderately large left effusion layering along the left chest wall
 and left apex, with underlying collapse and/or consolidation.  Minimal
 blunting of the right costophrenic angle is present.  There is atelectasis at
 the right base.  There is straightening of the AP window on the left and
 prominence of the right hilum.  This could reflect pulmonary hypertension.  A
 dual lumen right-sided catheter is present, distal tip overlying the right
 atrium.
 
 A slightly displaced left posterolateral third rib fracture again noted,
 unchanged.  This was present on a chest x-ray dated ___.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Continued CHF, probably slightly worse compared with ___.
 2.  Left pleural fluid/thickening, left lower lobe collapse and/or
 consolidation, overall similar.

 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female status post Bentall and mitral valve
 vegetation removal, here to re-evaluate for pleural effusions.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright AP radiograph of the chest.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple preceding chest radiographs the most recent of which is
 dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in appropriate position with the tip
 terminating 45 mm above the carina.  A left-sided PICC line is unchanged in
 position with the tip projecting over the cavoatrial junction.  A right
 internal jugular large-bore central catheter is unchanged in position with the
 tip terminating in the right atrium.  An OG tube is  in appropriate position. 
 Bilateral pleural pigtail catheters are unchanged in position in the lower
 lobes.  Increased opacification in the left lower lobe could be a combination
 of left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis or in the
 appropriate clinical setting, focal consolidation.  A small right-sided
 pleural effusion is stable with persistent opacity in the peripheral right
 lower lobe most likely atelectasis.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy with an atrial valve prosthesis consistent with Bentall procedure. 
 The mediastinal contours are stable.  The cardiac silhouette is severely
 enlarged with an apparent gradual increase in size from prior studies which is
 concerning for pericardial effusion.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 1)  Increased opacification of the left lower lobe is most likely a small
 left-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis in this postoperative
 patient. 
 2)  Stable small right-sided pleural effusion with associated atelectasis. 
 3)  Increased size of enlarged cardiac silhouette over multiple priors and
 when compared to baseline raises the possibility of pericardial effusion.

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  Evaluation of the patient with urosepsis.
 
 Portable AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to ___.
 
 Right internal jugular line tip is currently low, at the level of the right
 atrium and should be pulled back approximately 2.3 cm.  There is interval
 placement of the right nephrostomy, partially imaged.  Pulmonary edema is
 still present, although minimally improved since the prior study.  Right
 middle lobe atelectasis and left retrocardiac density with air bronchogram
 persist, highly worrisome for pneumonia.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient status post open right colectomy with
 extensive lysis of adhesions for right cecal mass, now with nausea and
 vomiting around NG tube, check for placement.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___.  Mild degree of cardiomegaly
 as before, but no evidence of new pulmonary congestion or pleural effusions. 
 The presence of an NG tube is now seen and it can be followed through the
 stomach pointing towards the duodenum.  There exists a linear density on the
 right base, which was not present on the previous examination.  This finding
 is compatible with some aspiration, which may be related to the position of
 the NG tube as indicated in the requisition.  There is, however, no evidence
 of any large discrete pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates and the lateral
 pleural sinuses remain free from any fluid accumulation.  No pneumothorax is
 identified in the apical area.  An orthopedic stabilization plate in the lower
 neck area is seen and remains unchanged in position in comparison with the
 previous study.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Plate atelectasis on right right lung base, possibly related to
 position of NG tube.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the lung volumes have
 slightly decreased, which could potentially be caused by decreased ventilatory
 pressures.  As a consequence, the bilateral parenchymal opacities appear
 slightly denser than on the previous image.  The size of the cardiac
 silhouette is unchanged.  No new parenchymal opacities have newly occurred. 
 No pleural effusions are seen.  The monitoring and support devices are
 constant.

 HISTORY:  Decreased breath sounds and crackles at the right base, evaluate the
 lungs.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Generalized interstitial pulmonary abnormality could be mild edema.  Careful
 followup is advised because of the nodular quality of this abnormality which
 makes it imperative to exclude disseminated metastases or granulomatous
 infection.  Low lung volumes exaggerate hilar size, another region that should
 be evaluated with conventional radiographs when feasible.  Moderate
 cardiomegaly and large hiatus hernia are bigger today than they were in ___. 
 Pleural effusions are small if any.

 AP PORTABLE CHEST ___ AT ___ HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  Chest pain with known pericardial effusion.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Lung volumes are diminished which exaggerates the cardiomediastinal
 configuration.  However, even accounting for this change, there has been a
 relative dramatic increase in the size of the cardiac silhouette with now
 somewhat globular morphology.  Ill-defined opacity is noted in the
 retrocardiac left lower lobe which is likely atelectasis given the volume
 loss.  There is no focal consolidation.  No definite effusion or pneumothorax
 is seen.  The osseous structures are unremarkable.  Incidental note is made of
 internal fixation hardware, incompletely evaluated, involving the mid
 diaphysis of the right clavicle.  Tubing loops over the epigastric region and
 with the tip projecting at the dome of the left hemidiaphragm over the cardiac
 silhouette.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette even accounting
 for patient and technical factors.  This likely signifies at least an increase
 in the size of the apparently known pericardial effusion.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph from ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Frontal and lateral radiographs of the chest.  There is no obvious lobar
 airspace consolidation.  Increased perihilar opacities and interstitial
 markings are consistent with mild pulmonary edema.  The heart size is
 minimally enlarged.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Although
 the patient is somewhat rotated, rightward deviation of the trachea is likely
 secondary to tortuous aorta.  Marked kyphosis of the spine is unchanged. 
 There is a stable moderate-large hiatal hernia.

 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged.  There is perihilar fullness with a
 new widespread mild interstitial abnormality, which includes fairly prominent
 patchy perihilar opacities.  On the other hand, dense left basilar
 consolidation has nearly cleared.  However, there are new patchy right basilar

 FINDINGS:  The tip of a right-sided PICC line is difficult to visualize but is
 probably unchanged.  The lung volumes remain low.  There is an extensive
 consolidation in the right lower lung, probably in the right lower lobe.  The
 appearance is fairly similar to the more recent prior radiographs allowing for
 differences in technique although pulmonary vasculature is somewhat less
 prominent.  It is difficult to exclude small pleural effusions but no definite
 pleural effusion is seen.  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged, including cardiac enlargement.

 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect portable chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiograph from the same day acquired 1 to ___ hours apart as well as
 multiple other prior radiographs till ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 The patient has received a new orogastric tube, which ends into the stomach
 but its distal end is looped with its tip reaching up to the fundus of the
 stomach approximately.  Endotracheal tube tip is 4 cm above the carina and is
 appropriately positioned.  Right internal jugular line tip is approximately at
 the level of the lower SVC/cavoatrial junction.  Bilateral lung volumes are
 low.  Mild diffuse haze in both lungs could be mild pulmonary edema, but given
 the low lung volumes, its appearance and severity may be exaggerated.
 Prominent hilus and azygos distension suggest increased venous pressure. 
 Bi-basal opacity is due to combination of small effusion and accompanying
 atelectasis.  Heart size is mild-to-moderately large, unchanged since prior
 studies.  Increased retrocardiac density reflecting left lower lung
 atelectasis has worsened.

 Portable AP upright chest film, ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 There are persistent and slightly worsening opacities in the left upper and
 mid lung and right lower lung which would be concerning either for worsening
 edema or pneumonia.  Chain sutures are again identified abutting the minor
 fissure consistent with prior surgery.  Bilateral effusions, left greater than
 right, are again seen.  Persistent retrocardiac opacity may reflect
 compressive atelectasis, although infection in this region cannot be excluded.
 The patient is status post median sternotomy for CABG, but assessment of
 cardiac and mediastinal contours is difficult due to the patient's marked
 rotation on the current examination.  Left internal jugular central line
 continues to have its tip in the mid SVC.  Linear calcifications in the left
 upper hemithorax are felt to likely be pleural in etiology.  A portion of the
 inferior vena caval filter is imaged at the edge of the study.

 approximately 1.5 cm from the carina and should be withdrawn several
 centimeters for optimal positioning.  Enteric tube is also slightly withdrawn
 with side port just proximal to the GE junction and should be advanced.  Right
 mid lung surgical chain sutures again seen.  Streaky right mid lung and left
 lung base opacities may be due to atelectasis.  Fullness of the soft tissues
 in the right hilar region are seen, the etiology of which is uncertain.  Given
 prior surgery there could be scarring or post-treatment changes, although
 underlying mass is possible, and dedicated imaging should be performed when
 patient is amenable.  Mediastinal clips with median sternotomy wires again
 noted.  Filter projecting over the IVC.

 PORTABLE CHEST:  ___
 
 HISTORY:  Question pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  Two semi-upright views of the chest are compared to previous exam
 from ___.  There are hazy bibasilar opacities suggestive of layering
 effusions.  Linear opacity in the right mid lung abutting surgical chain
 sutures are seen, potentially scarring or contribution from fluid within the
 fissure.  Linear opacity in the left mid to lower lung is again seen
 suggestive of scarring or atelectasis.  There is cephalization of the
 vasculature and prominence of the azygos vein.  Cardiomediastinal silhouette
 is unchanged.  Osseous and soft tissue structures are also unchanged.  IVC
 filter is seen within the abdomen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral pleural effusions and pulmonary vascular congestion. 
 Post-surgical changes seen in the right lung.

 The pleural densities extend into the posterior compartments as identified on
 the lateral view.  There is no evidence of new acute pulmonary parenchymal
 infiltrates.  No evidence of pneumothorax exists in the apical area.  When
 comparison is made with the next preceding portable chest examination of
 ___, the described mostly basal located pleural thickenings were
 similar and appear rather stable.  The pulmonary vasculature appears, however,
 now slightly more congested.  Review of previous PA and lateral chest
 examinations from ___, ___ and ___ demonstrated that the pleural
 thickenings existed already at that time.  Considering the rather stable
 pleural thickenings could consider that they are at least in part organized

 AP CHEST 5:42 A.M.  ON ___:
 
 HISTORY:  Severe pulmonary fibrosis presenting with acute worsening shortness
 of breath.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Comparing today's study with ___, the low lung volumes are unchanged
 but there is greater opacification throughout both lungs, most readily
 attributed to worsening pulmonary edema in the setting of pre-existing severe
 pulmonary fibrosis.  Given the severity of the acute and chronic pulmonary
 abnormalities, concurrent pneumonia would be difficult to exclude
 radiographically but there is no asymmetry to suggest it.  The heart is mildly
 enlarged, but generally obscured by adjacent parenchymal pulmonary
 abnormalities.  There is no appreciable pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old male with history of chest pain, fever,
 shortness of breath, hypotension.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 There is another comparison, a reference made to chest CT from ___ and
 ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single, AP, upright, portable view of the chest was obtained. 
 There are increased interstitial marking.  Given history of pulmonary fibrosis
 on prior CT, although increased interstitial markings have significantly
 increased since the prior and there may be superimposed pulmonary edema.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal silhouettes are stable.  There is slight blunting of
 both costophrenic angles, felt most likely be due to overlying soft tissues,
 but a trace pleural effusions be difficult to exclude.  No right pleural
 effusion is seen.  There is no pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Increased markings bilaterally may be due to the combination of
 underlying pulmonary fibrosis and moderate pulmonary edema, superimposed
 infectious process cannot be excluded.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of ___, the patient has taken a
 slightly better inspiration.  Diffuse interstitial prominence persists in this
 patient with enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, most likely representing a
 combination of underlying pulmonary fibrosis and elevated pulmonary venous
 pressure.  In the appropriate setting, the possibility of supervening
 pneumonia would be difficult to exclude given the substrate of diffuse
 pulmonary disease.

 worsening shortness of breath.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiographs from ___ at 13:28 and 7:20.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since the prior exam, there is a new thin linear density along the
 left apex, which may represent a pneumothorax.  Alternatively, it could be a
 skinfold.  Additionally, there are worsening basilar opacities, right more
 than left, likely due to pulmonary edema from re-expansion after the right
 thoracentesis.  Patchy bilateral opacities are otherwise not significantly
 changed.  There is stable small left effusion.  The right costophrenic angle
 is somewhat obscured by overlying monitoring lines, though there is likely a
 small right effusion.  There is no right pneumothorax.  The cardiomediastinal
 silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Linear opacity along the left apex extending down laterally may represent
 a new pneumothorax.  Alternatively, it could represent a skinfold.  Recommend
 a repeat chest radiograph for further clarification.
 2.  Increasing basilar opacities, likely from worsening re-expansion edema. 
 There is a stable small left pleural effusion and likely a small residual
 right pleural effusion.  Scattered bilateral opacities are otherwise
 unchanged, likely reflective of the known multifocal pneumonia.

 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with worsening hypoxia.  Evaluate for
 worsening pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding similar
 study of ___.  The previously identified bilateral basal parenchymal
 infiltrates have increased in extension and occupy also the periphery of the
 lungs mid field area.  The lateral pleural sinuses remain free from any
 massive pleural effusion and no pneumothorax is seen in the apical area. 
 Comparison also indicates that the heart shadow has increased in size. 
 Remarkable is a more marked distention of the azygous vein, which would

 INDICATION:  Status post right thoracentesis.  Evaluate for pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Chest radiograph from ___ at 7:20.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  A single upright AP view of the chest was obtained.
 
 FINDINGS:  Since prior exam, the patient has undergone a right thoracentesis. 
 The right pleural effusion has nearly completely resolved.  Patchy
 interstitial opacity at the right base likely represents some reexpansion
 edema and residual atelectasis.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax.  A
 small left pleural effusion appears slightly larger than on the prior exam
 from earlier this morning.  Left basilar consolidation is likely atelectasis. 
 Other patchy bilateral opacities are unchanged, and consistent with the known
 pneumonia.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is normal.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Significant interval decrease in size of the right pleural effusion.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.
 2.  New right basilar consolidation is likely some reexpansion pulmonary
 edema.
 3.  Slight interval enlargement of small left pleural effusion with associated
 atelectasis.

 pneumothorax in this sitting is difficult.  Otherwise, the overall extent of
 bilateral subcutaneous emphysema is unchanged.  Multifocal lung opacities are
 similar. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Semi-erect chest view was read in comparison with prior chest
 radiographs through ___ with the most recent from ___.  Concurrently a chest CT from ___ was reviewed.
 
 FINDINGS:  Tracheostomy tube is in standard position.  Left subclavian line
 ends at the level of the mid SVC.  Extensive bilateral subcutaneous emphysema
 is unchanged.  Given the extent of subcutaneous emphysema, presence of small
 pneumothorax cannot be certainly identified.  The patient has known severe
 pulmonary emphysema, better evaluated on chest CT dated ___. 
 Multifocal Lung opacities are stable.  Right mid thoracic chest tube is
 similar in position. Heart size and Mediastinal contours have similar
 appearance.

 INDICATION:  Difficulty venting, evaluation for interval change.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, there is no relevant
 change.  The extensive right lower lung opacity and the opacity along the
 right chest tube are constant.  Massive air collection in the soft tissues,
 leading to dissection into muscle tissue and subsequent display of multiple
 linear structures.  There is no currently obvious pneumothorax.  Unchanged
 position of the monitoring and support devices, with exception of the
 nasogastric tube that has been removed in the interval.  Unchanged small
 cardiac silhouette.

 REASON FOR EXAMINATION:  NG tube placement in a patient with COPD substantial
 subcutaneous air.
 
 COMPARISONS:  AP radiograph of the chest was reviewed in comparison to prior
 study obtained the same day earlier.
 
 FINDINGS:  The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm, most likely terminating
 in the stomach.  There is no change in the appearance of the right chest tube,
 left subclavian line and ET tube.  Extensive subcutaneous air collections are
 widespread throughout the entire chest.  Bilateral focal consolidations within
 the lungs appear unchanged.

 PORTABLE CHEST:
 
 COMPARISON:  Radiograph, ___ and ___ as well as chest CT
 of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  The presence of extensive subcutaneous emphysema reduces the
 sensitivity of chest radiography for detecting pneumothoraces.  With this
 limitation in mind, no pneumothorax is identified.  Left chest tube has been
 removed since the prior study, and right chest tube is unchanged in position. 
 Endotracheal tube remains in standard position, but cuff appears slightly
 overdistended.  Heart size is normal.  Worsening heterogeneous airspace
 opacities in right lower lobe are concerning for aspiration or evolving
 infectious pneumonia.  Numerous air-fluid levels are again demonstrated in the
 left upper lobe lateral to the left hilum, and may reflect hemorrhage or
 infection within a bullae.  An adjacent area of consolidation is present in
 this region as well.  As compared to the recent study of ___, the
 degree of subcutaneous emphysema has worsened, and is particularly more marked
 in the neck, axilla and lateral chest wall as compared to the prior studies.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No evidence of pneumothorax following removal of left-sided chest tube,
 but extensive subcutaneous emphysema reduces the sensitivity of radiography
 for detecting pneumothoraces.
 2.  Worsening right lower lobe airspace opacity, concerning for developing
 pneumonia in the appropriate clinical setting.
 3.  Progressive diffuse subcutaneous emphysema.
 4.  Severe emphysema.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  ___-year-old with COPD, hypertension, AFIB, presenting
 with dyspnea, intubated for respiratory failure, any signs of pneumonia. 
 
 Comparison to prior study of ___ at ___.
 
 A single portable semi-erect chest film ___ at ___ is submitted.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Left subclavian central line has its tip in the superior vena cava. 
 Endotracheal tube has its tip below the thoracic inlet, unchanged. 
 Nasogastric tube is seen coursing below the diaphragm.  Right chest tube
 remains in satisfactory position.
 
 2.  Extensive subcutaneous emphysema which somewhat limits evaluation of the
 lungs. The lungs remain markedly hyperinflated consistent with known
 underlying emphysema.  When compared to previous studies dating back to
 ___, the more focal airspace opacity in the left upper to mid
 lung has progressed and therefore is concerning for an evolving pneumonia. 
 There has been interval decrease in elliptical opacity in the right mid lung
 near the chest tube likely representing fluid loculated within the horizontal
 fissure.  No pneumothorax can be appreciated.  Overall cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are likely stable.

 HISTORY:  Check tube placements, pneumonia, and pneumothorax.
 
 IMPRESSIONS:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Very severe subcutaneous emphysema of the entire torso has not improved.  The
 overlying subcutaneous gas makes it difficult to detect pneumothorax but I see
 no good evidence of any nor is there any appreciable pleural effusion.  The
 hematoma around the pulmonary laceration of the right pleural tube is slightly
 smaller today than it was on ___ but stable since ___.  A region
 of hemorrhage in the axillary region in the left mid lung has been stable for

 bronchial wall thickening on the right side also identified.  The left
 subclavian stent is identified.  Heavy vascular calcification is noted.
 
 Reference to prior studies is made.  When compared to the most recent study,
 there is probably less overall congestive change, but this has revealed the
 lower lobe bronchial wall thickening.  This is nonspecific, may reflect either
 failure or a bronchial infection.  There is no pneumonia.  The left lower lobe
 effusion may be marginally bigger than on the prior study.

 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with pleural effusions and chronic
 PleurX catheter line, status post TPA administration.  Evaluate for possible
 pneumothorax or change in effusion.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.  There is no evidence of
 pneumothorax on either side which can be identified with this portable single
 view examination.  Comparison with the next previous study suggests that the
 right-sided massive pleural densities have changed in position slightly and as
 much, there is improved aeration of the right upper lobe area and the
 previously identified large pleural density in the right axillary area
 impressing on the aerated lung tissue has clearly decreased.  On the other
 hand, it is impossible to assess whether the loculated pleural effusion has
 shifted more to the lower areas.  Again, portable chest examination does not
 allow assessment of the right-sided subhilar and parenchymal abnormalities. 
 No new abnormalities are identified in the left hemithorax as there was no
 repeat lateral view, one cannot comment on the amount of pleural effusion on
 the left side identified on the preceding study.  The draining PleurX catheter
 remains in place.

 AP CHEST, 6:18 P.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  Esophagectomy, evaluate lung expansion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest reviewed in the absence of prior chest radiographs:
 
 Widening of the upper mediastinum to the right of the midline could be due to
 fluid filling in the esophagus, drained by an upper alimentary tube, ending in
 the lower third of the right paramedian mediastinum.  ET tube is in standard
 placement.  Lungs are well expanded.  Pulmonary edema is mild.  Extensive
 subcutaneous emphysema can be a normal finding this early after this type of

 HISTORY:  Cough, back pain.  Question pneumonia or mass.
 
 COMPARISONS:  Recent radiographs from ___ as well as radiographs
 going back to ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, PA and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 There is similar unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged including a convexity along the right upper
 mediastinal contour.  Particularly since it appears stable over time, it can
 probably be attributed to tortuosity of the great vessels.  
 
 At both lung bases, but more extensive on the right than left, there are
 patchy opacities, fairly streaky in nature but extensive.  These are increased
 since the earlier examination and are accompanied by peribronchial cuffing. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 Suspected mild loss in mid thoracic vertebral body heights appears unchanged
 and probably coincides with demineralization.  The lower thoracic spine shows
 mild rightward convex curvature.  There is wedging of an upper lumbar
 vertebral body which may be increased somewhat, although the apparent
 difference may be due to differences in orientation.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Increasing bibasilar opacities which could be seen with lower airway
 inflammation or infection, although developing bronchopneumonia is not

 FINDINGS:  The heart is mildly enlarged with a left ventricular configuration.
 There is similar unfolding of the thoracic aorta.  The mediastinal and hilar
 contours appear unchanged including a convexity along the right upper
 mediastinal contour.  Particularly since it appears stable over time, it can
 probably be attributed to tortuosity of the great vessels.  
 
 At both lung bases, but more extensive on the right than left, there are
 patchy opacities, fairly streaky in nature but extensive.  These are increased
 since the earlier examination and are accompanied by peribronchial cuffing. 
 There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  
 
 Suspected mild loss in mid thoracic vertebral body heights appears unchanged
 and probably coincides with demineralization.  The lower thoracic spine shows
 mild rightward convex curvature.  There is wedging of an upper lumbar
 vertebral body which may be increased somewhat, although the apparent
 difference may be due to differences in orientation.   
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Increasing bibasilar opacities which could be seen with lower airway
 inflammation or infection, although developing bronchopneumonia is not
 entirely excluded.  
 
 2.  Mild anterior wedge compression deformity of a vertebral body at the
 thoracolumbar junction, likely L1; although probably chronic, potentially
 increased somewhat.

 SINGLE FRONTAL VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Cardiac and mediastinal contours are
 normal.  The heart remains moderately enlarged.  There is mild blunting of the
 left costophrenic angle, again seen, which may reflect pleural thickening or
 small pleural effusion.  Vague opacities within the right-mid lung may
 represent atelctasis or early pneumonia.  There is no pneumothorax or findings
 for pulmonary edema.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right mid lung opacity may be atelctasis but could be early
 pneumonia in the right clinical setting.

 substantially resolved.  Small residual pneumothorax persists, but no evidence
 of tension. Small amount of pneumopericardium is likely related to recent
 surgery.  Minimal atelectasis is present in the left lung base.  There is no
 pleural effusion.  Patient is status post median sternotomy, and sternal
 sutures are intact. Postoperative mediastinal widening and mildly enlarged
 heart size are stable.   Endotracheal tube ends approximately 1.7 cm above the
 carina.  Consider retracting the ET tube by 2 cm for appropriate seating. 
 Orogastric tube ends into the stomach, and a Swan-Ganz catheter through the
 right internal jugular approach terminates approximately in the right main
 pulmonary artery.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 Following left chest tube placement, a left pneumothorax has markedly
 decreased in size with small residual basilar pneumothorax.

 1.  Nerve stimulating device is seen overlying the lateral left upper lung. 
 Right apical pneumothorax appears stable.  Patchy opacities in the right upper
 lobe in the right mid and lower lung are unchanged, which could reflect
 resolving contusions, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded.  The
 left lung is essentially clear with the exception of a linear opacity in the
 retrocardiac region which may represent an area of subsegmental atelectasis or
 scarring.  No evidence of pulmonary edema.  No pleural effusions.  Multiple
 right-sided rib fractures with associated pleural thickening are again noted.

 HISTORY:  Intubated.  Cardiorespiratory insufficiency.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Homogeneous opacification of the right lower hemithorax medially could be due
 to either consolidation in the right lower lobe or posteriorly layering
 pleural effusion, best evaluated with an upright chest radiograph when
 feasible.  Left lung is clear.  Heart size is normal.  Mediastinal and hilar
 silhouettes are normal, and the costopleural surfaces are unremarkable.  No
 evidence of pneumothorax.  ET tube is in standard placement, and a nasogastric
 tube passes into the stomach and out of view.  Intraaortic balloon pump ends
 midway between the upper margin of the left main bronchus and the apex of the
 aortic knob, approximately 3.5 cm from the latter.

 HISTORY:  ___-year-old man intubated for hypoxic respiratory failure during
 cardiac catheterization.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Minimal edema persists in the right lower lung, considerable improvement since
 ___.  Mildly enlarged heart is unchanged.  There is no appreciable
 pleural effusion and no pneumothorax or substantial atelectasis.  ET tube is
 in standard placement.  Nasogastric tube passes into the stomach and out of
 view.
 
 Depending on clinical circumstances, the markedly unilateral pulmonary edema
 on ___ could have been due to previous right decubitus positioning or
 concurrent pulmonary edema and a large pulmonary embolism preventing perfusion
 to the left lung.  Dr. ___ and I discussed those findings and their
 clinical significance by telephone at the time of dictation.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest, AP portable, single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient, intubated, with intraaortic balloon
 pump device, now status post orogastric tube placement.  Evaluate.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis performed in direct comparison with the next
 preceding portable chest examination of ___, i.e. 11 hours earlier during
 the same day.  The patient has now been intubated and ETT seen in the trachea
 to terminate some 4 cm above the level of the carina.  No pneumothorax has
 developed.  Identified is also an intra-aortic balloon pump device in the
 aorta with the metallic tip reaching just to the lower contour of the aortic
 arch.  Thus, the position is appropriate.  No pneumothorax has developed in
 comparison with the previous study.  Remarkable finding is a diffuse haze over
 the right hemithorax, more marked than on the left side.  This may be
 explained by a shift of the interstitial edema pattern seen already on
 previous examination as faintly detectable interstitial edema.  An explanation
 could be that the patient during the latest examination interval was mostly
 located on the right side explaining gravitational forces.  There is no
 evidence of overall deterioration of the pulmonary congestion nor is there
 evidence of any new parenchymal infiltrate.  An OG tube passes well through
 the esophagus and reaches into the stomach.

 are no pleural effusions or pneumothorax.  Thin anterior flowing
 syndesmophytes are present along the lateral and anterior aspects of the
 visualized thoracic spine, which could be seen with idiopathic skeletal
 hyperostosis.

 INDICATION:  Chest pain radiating to the back, here to evaluate for evidence
 of aortic dissection.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph dated ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable upright frontal radiograph of the chest.
 
 FINDINGS:  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is prominent but stable.  The
 cardiac silhouette is enlarged with prior coronary stenting noted. 
 Calcification at the aortic knob is unchanged.  A large bore left-sided
 central venous catheter is unchanged in position with the tip terminating in
 the right atrium.  The pulmonary vasculature is prominent with mild
 interstitial pulmonary edema, slightly improved from ___.  There is
 increased right perihilar opacification from the most recent prior study also
 likely due to pulmonary edema.  Streaky opacities at the bilateral lung bases
 most likely reflect atelectasis; however, superimposed infection is not
 excluded in the appropriate clinical context.  There is a small right pleural

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with severe COPD and new pedal edema
 and worsening shortness of breath.  Assess for any evidence of CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar chest examination ___ ___.  There is status post sternotomy
 and aortic valve replacement identifying the metallic components of a porcine
 aortic valve stenosis in place.  These findings are rather unchanged.  The
 heart size has increased slightly.  No typical new configurational abnormality
 can be identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested, nor is there
 evidence.  Marked left atrial enlargement when comparing the posterior cardiac
 wall in relation to the aortic valve prosthesis on the lateral view.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  On the other hand, the pulmonary
 vasculature shows again the previously described marked irregular peripheral
 distribution that coincides with low positioned and flattened diaphragms. 
 Marked increase of chest diameter in depth is noted on the lateral view and
 related to a markedly increased kyphotic curvature with multiple wedge
 compressed vertebral bodies in the mid portion of the thoracic spine.  As
 before, one sees multiple peripheral small linear densities and areas of
 increased translucency rather typical for advanced COPD.  Comparison with the
 next preceding study ___ ___ does not disclose any new discrete
 parenchymal infiltrate.  Also, the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses
 remain free from any significant fluid accumulation.  Bilateral apical pleural
 thickenings are again seen and have not undergone any significant interval
 change.  Multiple rib deformities as before indicative of previously sustained
 local rib fractures.  Comparison with the next preceding chest examination
 demonstrates on the frontal view increase of the heart shadow.  This coincides
 also with a more prominent visibility of the azygos vein in the right
 tracheobronchial angulation.  Thus, these findings could suggest a volume
 increase of the right ventricle and thereto related elevated right-sided
 filling pressure, a suggestion which matches information that the would
 recommend the performance of an echocardiogram to look for possible right

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with severe COPD and new pedal edema
 and worsening shortness of breath.  Assess for any evidence of CHF.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the next preceding
 similar chest examination ___ ___.  There is status post sternotomy
 and aortic valve replacement identifying the metallic components of a porcine
 aortic valve stenosis in place.  These findings are rather unchanged.  The
 heart size has increased slightly.  No typical new configurational abnormality
 can be identified.  The pulmonary vasculature is not congested, nor is there
 evidence.  Marked left atrial enlargement when comparing the posterior cardiac
 wall in relation to the aortic valve prosthesis on the lateral view.  The
 pulmonary vasculature is not congested.  On the other hand, the pulmonary
 vasculature shows again the previously described marked irregular peripheral
 distribution that coincides with low positioned and flattened diaphragms. 
 Marked increase of chest diameter in depth is noted on the lateral view and
 related to a markedly increased kyphotic curvature with multiple wedge
 compressed vertebral bodies in the mid portion of the thoracic spine.  As
 before, one sees multiple peripheral small linear densities and areas of
 increased translucency rather typical for advanced COPD.  Comparison with the
 next preceding study ___ ___ does not disclose any new discrete
 parenchymal infiltrate.  Also, the lateral and posterior pleural sinuses
 remain free from any significant fluid accumulation.  Bilateral apical pleural
 thickenings are again seen and have not undergone any significant interval
 change.  Multiple rib deformities as before indicative of previously sustained
 local rib fractures.  Comparison with the next preceding chest examination
 demonstrates on the frontal view increase of the heart shadow.  This coincides
 also with a more prominent visibility of the azygos vein in the right
 tracheobronchial angulation.  Thus, these findings could suggest a volume
 increase of the right ventricle and thereto related elevated right-sided
 filling pressure, a suggestion which matches information that the would
 recommend the performance of an echocardiogram to look for possible right
 ventricular strain, tricuspid incompetence and elevated right-sided filling
 pressure.

 EXAM:  Chest, single AP upright portable view.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Recent sepsis.  Rule out pneumonia.  Check PICC line
 placement on the left.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Single AP upright portable view of the chest was obtained.  There
 has been interval placement of left-sided PICC, which terminates in the low
 SVC.  Previously seen right-sided PICC which is curled in the right axilla is
 no longer seen.  There is also interval removal of previously seen right-sided
 internal jugular central venous catheter.  The patient is status post median
 sternotomy.  The cardiac silhouette remains moderately enlarged.  Mediastinal
 contours are stable, with the aorta tortuous and unfolded.  There appears to
 have been slight interval increase in bilateral pleural effusions which may in
 part relate to differences in patient position.  There are increased perihilar
 opacities suggesting pulmonary edema.  Left base retrocardiac opacity may be
 due to combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis; however, underlying
 consolidation is not excluded.  No pneumothorax is seen.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Persistent moderate enlargement of the cardiac silhouette. 
 Bilateral pleural effusions, likely slightly increased.  Increased perihilar
 opacities most likely related to pulmonary edema; however, an atypical
 infection is not entirely excluded in appropriate clinical setting.  Left
 basilar opacity may represent combination of pleural effusion and atelectasis;
 however, underlying consolidation is not excluded.

 AP SEMI-ERECT PORTABLE CHEST, ___ AT ___ HOURS.
 
 HISTORY:  Pneumothorax post chest tube placement.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated ___.  Please
 note the patient also had a chest CT earlier same day.
 
 FINDINGS:  Consistent with the given history, a chest tube is noted and is
 directed medially in the upper mediastinum with a location that is highly
 suggestive of intrafissural placement.  There is increased lucency at the lung
 base, particularly outlining the right hemidiaphragm, which likely indicates a
 residual component of the pneumothorax.  Diffuse bilateral pulmonary nodules
 consistent with widespread metastatic disease are again present.  There is air
 noted around a ray cage device in the lower thoracic spine, surrounded by
 posterior spinal stabilization rods.  Extensive surgical clips are noted
 within the medial left upper quadrant.  It is difficult to discern the left
 hemidiaphragm.  There is increased retrocardiac opacity, although similar to
 the prior exam.  A Port-A-Cath is evident in stable and standard course and
 position.  The osseous structures are difficult to assess, but are grossly
 stable.
 
 IMPRESSION:  The course of the chest tube projecting over the right chest
 suggests an intrafissural position, which may limit the ability to evacuate
 the pneumothorax.  A visceral pleural line remains evident and most apparent
 at the lung base with an extension of the air to the spinal hardware as noted
 on the CT earlier today.  Widespread metastatic disease of the lungs is again
 seen.  There is no radiographic evidence currently of tension physiology.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with anterior chest fluid collection,
 evaluate for fluid collection.
 
 FINDINGS:  An AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison
 with the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination of ___. 
 On the previous examination, the patient had a pigtail drainage catheter
 placed anteriorly to the chest wall in an apparent presternal soft tissue
 cavity in this patient with a history of sternal dehiscence.  The pigtail
 catheter has been removed.  On the present frontal single view examination,
 one can identify a thin-wall line apparently entering the right lower anterior
 chest wall reaching the superior portion of the thorax where it terminates
 overlying the infraclavicular junction.  On this single chest view, no
 pneumothorax can be identified and no new pulmonary abnormalities are seen. 
 Unfortunately, the examination did not include a lateral view at this time,
 which is the essential component to evaluate the presternal anatomy in the
 patient's anterior chest wall.  The chest CT examination ___ ___ is
 reviewed from this study is apparent that the anterior chest wall cavity is
 filled with large amount of fluid, which communicates through the dehisced
 sternum into the mediastinal structures.  Additional lateral view is mandatory
 for evaluation of this unusual finding.  Potential drainage could be monitored
 under fluoroscopic control.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.
 
 INDICATION:  ___-year-old male patient with left-sided pleural effusion, status
 post uncomplicated thoracocentesis with 750 cc of serous fluid removed. 
 Evaluate for possible pneumothorax.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 sitting semi-upright position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding
 portable chest examination of ___.  During the examination interval,
 successful and uncomplicated left-sided thoracocentesis was performed.  The
 lung fields have cleared up and the left diaphragmatic contour is now visible.
 The left lateral pleural sinus is free from any blunting pleural effusion. 
 Volume of left hemithorax still remains reduced in comparison to the more
 normal appearing right-sided hemithorax.  This most likely is related to the
 earlier described paramediastinal mass in the left hilar area.  Previously
 described permanent pacer in left anterior axillary position with dual
 intracavitary electrode system is unchanged.  No pneumothorax has developed on
 either side.

 INDICATION:  Chest pain.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 PORTABLE UPRIGHT AP VIEW OF THE CHEST:  Study is limited as the left
 costophrenic angle is excluded from the field-of-view.  Left-sided
 dual-chamber pacemaker with leads terminating in the right atrium and right
 ventricle is unchanged.  Again noted is a left upper lobe paramediastinal
 mass.  Opacification in the left lung base likely reflects a combination of a
 moderate-to-large pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis.  The right lung
 is grossly clear.  There is no pulmonary vascular congestion.
 
 IMPRESSION:  No significant interval change from the prior exam.  No evidence
 of congestive heart failure.  Persistent left pleural effusion and left
 basilar opacity likely reflective of atelectasis.  Left upper lobe
 paramediastinal mass compatible with known malignancy.

 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___ 
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of left pneumothorax following the recent
 procedure.  Left juxtahilar mass is again demonstrated with adjacent
 parenchymal opacities which likely represent post-obstructive atelectasis and
 pneumonia.  As compared to the recent radiograph, the left upper lobe opacity
 appears more dense, possibly due to progressive post-obstructive
 abnormalities, but co-existing hemorrhage or aspiration are certainly possible
 in the setting of a recent procedure.  Short-term followup radiograph may be
 helpful in this regard.

 HISTORY:  ORIF for hip fracture, to assess for pulmonary process.
 
 FINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there are even lower lung
 volumes.  The head of the patient somewhat obscures the upper mediastinum. 
 Nasogastric tube remains in place, though the endotracheal tube appears to
 have been removed.  There is evidence of pulmonary vascular congestion with
 blunted costophrenic angles that could reflect atelectasis and effusion.  On
 this study, it is impossible to exclude a supervening pneumonia.

 PORTABLE CHEST OF ___
 
 COMPARISON:  ___ radiograph.
 
 FINDINGS:  Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged in position with
 persistent widening of right mediastinal contour, a change in appearance from
 a standard PA and lateral chest radiograph of ___ but similar to the
 ___ radiograph.  This could potentially be due to accentuation of
 tortuous vascular structures by low lung volumes and portable semi-erect
 technique, but attention to this area on repeat study with improved
 inspiratory volume would be helpful to exclude a mediastinal mass or
 hemorrhage.  Slight improvement in bibasilar atelectasis.  No new areas of
 lung opacification.  Persistent small bilateral pleural effusions, seen to
 better detail on recent abdominal CT of the same date.  Multiple bilateral
 healed rib fractures.

 As far as I can tell, given the severe anatomic distortion of the chest cage
 and its contents, lungs were clear on ___.  Small region of
 opacification may have been developing lateral to the left hilus on ___, and today there is a suggestion of some new opacification at the base of
 the lung, but these observations are far from certain.  I am not even
 confident that conventional radiographs, should the patient be able to
 cooperate for them, would clarify the issue.  CT scanning, if feasible, would
 certainly confirm if the lungs are clear, but in the absence of a baseline
 study it might be difficult to distinguish atelectasis from pneumonia. 
 Pleural effusion is minimal if any.  Heart is probably not enlarged. 
 Nasogastric tube is looped in the stomach.  Right PIC line ends in the mid
 SVC.  No pneumothorax.

 INDICATION:  Mental status changes, presenting from nursing home.  Please
 evaluate for pneumonia.
 
 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to chest radiograph performed ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP and lateral chest radiographs demonstrate stable bilateral low
 lung volumes with persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm with air
 distended bowel beneath.  Mediastinal contours are stable.  The cardiac
 contour is not well evaluated due to elevation of the diaphragm.  Compared to
 prior study, there is increased pulmonary vascular congestion.  No focal
 opacification concerning for pneumonia identified.  No pleural effusion or
 pneumothorax evident.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Low lung volumes.  No focal opacification concerning for
 pneumonia.  Mild prominence of the pulmonary vasculature may indicate mild
 volume overload.

 EXAM:  Chest frontal and lateral views.
 
 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  ___-year-old female with history of cough and fever.
 
 COMPARISON:  ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Frontal and lateral views of the chest are obtained.  Right lower
 lobe opacity is worrisome for consolidation, possibly due to pneumonia.  
 Along the superior aspect of the right lower lung consolidation, there is a
 0.9-cm nodular opacity, projecting between the posterior right sixth and
 seventh ribs, which could relate to consolidation or an underlying pulmonary
 nodule is not excluded.  Recommend followup chest radiograph after appropriate
 therapy and if finding remains, chest CT.  There is also a left suprahilar
 opacity, which could be a second site of infection or relate to mild volume
 overload.  There is central pulmonary vascular engorgement.  No large pleural
 effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  Single-lead left-sided pacemaker is seen
 with leads in the expected position of the right ventricle.  The cardiac
 silhouette is enlarged.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Right lower lobe and left infrahilar opacities, right greater
 than left, in the appropriate clinical setting, raises concern for pneumonia. 
 Recommend followup to resolution. Possible 0.9 cm nodular opacity along the
 superior aspect of the right lower lung opacity, could relate to
 consolidation, but pulmonary nodule not excluded.  Recommend followup chest
 radiographs after appropriate therapy and if finding remains, chest CT.
 
 Left suprahilar opacity, which could be a second site of infection or relate
 to mild volume overload.

 respiratory distress in the setting of an asthma exacerbation and viral
 illness.
 
 COMPARISON:  Multiple chest radiographs, the most recent of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:  Portable AP ___-degree upright view of the chest was reviewed and
 compared to the prior studies.  An endotracheal tube ends 4 cm above the
 carina.  A left-sided internal jugular line ends in the upper SVC and a
 right-sided internal jugular line ends in the mid superior vena cava.  Upper
 enteric tube passes into the stomach and off the radiograph.  Right upper lobe
 predominant pulmonary edema has improved on today's study, however, right
 upper lobe atelectasis persists. Right middle lobe atelectasis is also
 unchanged.  Upper lung vascular redistribution and enlarged pulmonary arteries
 are chronic.  Moderate-to-severe cardiomegaly is unchanged. A small right
 pleural effusion has increased.  Median sternotomy wires are aligned and
 intact.

 esophagogastroduodenoscopy and dilatation of neoesophagus, assessment for
 mediastinal air.
 
 Note is made that the study was obtained yesterday at 4:40 p.m. and brought to
 our attention today at 8:05 a.m.
 
 There is linear vertical lucency running parallel to the right border of the
 spine, continuing from the level of the carina upwards towards the neck and
 might potentially reflect air within the mediastinum.  Alternatively, it can
 represent air within the neoesophagus but that is less likely.
 
 There is interval improvement of the right mid lung consolidation.  The
 bulging contour of the right mid mediastinum most likely reflects dilated
 neoesophagus.
 
 There is new left lower lung opacity that potentially might reflect
 aspiration.  Heart size is unremarkable.
 
 Findings were discussed with Dr. ___ at 9 a.m. with the recommendation to
 repeat chest radiograph to exclude the possibility of pneumomediastinum and
 discover of the findings was made 1 hour ago and Dr. ___ was immediately
 paged.

 also similar to the prior CT.  Bilateral right worse than left parenchymal
 opacities have progressed from the prior radiograph as well as CT, again
 concerning for multifocal infection and/or metastases.  A right pleural
 effusion may be trace.  The left pleural effusion may have resolved in the
 interim.  No pneumothorax.
 
 The heart is normal in size.  Mild prominence of the right mediastinum may
 correspond to the known mild ascending thoracic aortic aneurysm on prior CT. 
 The size of the mediastinum is similar to the prior exam.  Calcified right
 mediastinal lymph node is unchanged.
 
 Catheter projecting over the lower portion of the SVC is unchanged.  Coils
 projecting over the left upper abdomen are also unchanged.  Coarse
 calcifications projecting over the left upper abdomen are unchanged from the
 prior radiograph in correspond to splenic calcifications on the prior CT.

 HISTORY:  ET tube, trauma line not bolusing.  Question trauma line
 positioning.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray from ___ at 10:21 a.m.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW
 
 The carina is not well delineated.  Allowing for this, the ET tube lies
 approximately 4.6-5.3 cm above the carina.  An NG tube is present -- the tip
 extends beneath diaphragm, off film.  Additional tubing is looped over the
 upper abdomen in the midline.  A right IJ sheath is present, tip over distal
 IJ, proximal to its point of confluence with the subclavian vessel.  Of note,
 a stent is present in this location.  An additional stent is seen along the
 expected course of the left innominate vein.  
 
 The lungs are hyperinflated.  The heart lies to the left of midline, raising
 the question of some volume loss on the left side.  There is increased
 retrocardiac density.  There are prominent interstitial markings in both
 lungs, of uncertain etiology or significance. The hila are obscured by the
 interstitial markings.  No gross effusion. 
 
 Innumerable calcific densities in the spleen suggest prior granulomatous
 disease.  Two calcified nodes are also seen along the expected course of the
 splenic artery.  Question also a calcified node in the neck.  
 
 The bones appear diffusely dense. 
 
 Compared to ___, no definite change is detected.  Increased retrocardiac
 density consistent with left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation is again
 seen. 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 1.  Right IJ sheath position appears slightly proximal to the right subclavian
 vein at the site where a stent is seen.  There is also kinking of the sheath
 at the skin.  Correlation with specifics of clinical presentation is
 requested.Targeted review of the report from a ___ chest CT refers to
 occlusion of the left subclavian vein stent.
 
 2.  Left lower lobe collapse and/or consolidation and minimal patchy opacity
 at the right base, unchanged.
 
 3.  Extensive calcified granulomas, similar to prior.
 
 4.  Diffusely increased osseous density.  There is an extensive differential,
 which should be correlated with the clinical presentation.  The differential
 includes changes due to osteodystrophy.  In the appropriate clinical setting,
 osteosclerosis could have a similar appearance.

 The tracheostomy tube midline and unchanged.  The right subclavian and
 brachiocephalic vein stent appears similar to prior.  The left brachiocephalic
 stent is unchanged.  The vascular catheter coursing through the IVC terminates
 in SVC.
 
 The diffuse bilateral lung opacities have increased slightly.  This is
 concerning for multifocal pneumonia.  The opacities in the left lung appears
 or nodule and discrete.  With known history of squamous cell carcinoma of the
 tongue, nodular metastases is on the differential.  Bilateral lower lobe
 atelectasis is stable.  The mild to moderate right pleural effusion is stable.
 Minimal pleural effusion in the left lung.  No pneumothorax.  Mediastinal
 silhouette is unchanged.  Splenic ossification is again seen and unchanged. 
 The visualized vertebrae appear more sclerotic which could represent osseous
 metastases.
 
 IMPRESSION: 
 
 1.  Increased diffuse opacification is concerning for multifocal pneumonia.
 
 2.  The left lung discrete nodular opacities are also worrisome for nodular
 metastases.
 
 3.  The sclerotic vertebrae are concerning for osseous metastases.

 questionable left-sided pneumonia.
 
 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the chest has been obtained with patient in
 semi-upright position.  Analysis is performed in direct comparison with the
 next preceding similar study of ___.  Status post thoracotomy, moderate
 cardiac enlargement and evidence of aortic valve prosthesis as well as
 tricuspid valve annuloplasty as before.  The removal of the right-sided
 pleural effusion of the preceding day remains successful as the right-sided
 diaphragmatic contour and pleural sinus is free, demonstrating the pigtail-end
 catheter in unchanged position.  No pneumothorax has developed.  The pulmonary
 vascular pattern again demonstrates perivascular haze throughout which in
 comparison appears slightly increased again.  This may have led to question a
 left-sided pneumonia, a diagnosis which is questionable.
 
 IMPRESSION: Persistent successful status post right-sided thoracocentesis,
 mildly increasing pulmonary congestive pattern with perivascular haze. 
 Diagnosis of left-sided pneumonic infiltrate is questionable unless compelling
 clinical findings are present.

 INDICATION:  Patient with bronchoscopy, lavage, pneumothorax.
 
 COMPARISON:  Chest CT of ___.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Left lung lavage was recently done, explaining probably the increased density
 of left middle lung.  There is a small left pneumothorax measuring 3 to 6 mm. 
 Mild pulmonary edema is new.  Pleural effusions are small, if any.  Minor
 fissure on the right side is slightly thickened with an atelectatic band in
 right lower lung.  Mediastinal and cardiac contours are moderately enlarged. 
 Aortic knob calcification is unchanged.  Patient had prior sternotomy for
 aortic valve, mitral valve and tricuspid valve repair.
 
 CONCLUSION:
 
 1.  Left middle lung increased density is probably related to recent lavage.
 2.  Left apical pneumothorax is small.
 3.  Pulmonary edema is also mild.  
 
 This has been discussed with ___ ___.

 INDICATION:  ___-year-old female patient with recent history of right pleural

 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral chest views were obtained with patient in upright
 position.  Comparison is made with the next preceding portable AP single view
 chest examination of ___.  The patient is now examined in
 standing upright position.  There is status post sternotomy and significant
 cardiac enlargement as before.  Within the cardiac shadow, metallic portions
 of three different valve prostheses can be identified.  One is a circular
 metallic ring in the position of the aortic valve, the second one a similar
 oval-shaped ring formation in the mitral valve position, and the third one an
 open circle rather typical for a tricuspid valve annuloplasty.  Correlating
 the position of these valves to the outer contours of the heart, one can state
 that there is remaining marked enlargement of the left atrium, but the
 increased distance between the tricuspid valvuloplasty and the anterior heart
 border speaks much in favor of a right ventricular enlargement as well as an
 enlarged right atrium.  Prominence of the ascending aortic contour is
 moderate.  The pulmonary vasculature is presently not congested, and on
 previous portable examination identified edema pattern as well as evidence of
 right-sided pleural effusion has normalized.  No new parenchymal abnormalities
 are seen, and no pneumothorax is identified in the apical area.  Again
 observed is a fractured second rib in the left apical area, apparently the
 result of previous sternotomy and intrathoracic cardiac intervention.  When
 comparison is extended to the next preceding PA and lateral chest examination
 of ___, the patient is in better condition now as the cardiac
 enlargement has regressed and the pleural effusion has been absorbed
 completely.

 FINDINGS:  Single AP view of the chest was reviewed.  There has been interval
 increase in the right pleural effusion, now moderate, with right basilar
 atelectasis.  Mild edema is also seen. There is no pneumothorax. The presence
 of the right pleural effusion limits assessment of the right cardiomediastinal

 at the level of the aortic arch, in keeping with known left-sided superior
 vena cava.  The tip of the catheter continues to terminate just above the
 level of the diaphragm to the left of midline, and could be withdrawn
 approximately 8 cm to ensure positioning within the lower left superior vena
 cava.  Cardiomediastinal contours are stable in appearance.  Moderate right
 pleural effusion with subpulmonic component has slightly increased in size. 
 Adjacent area of opacity within the right middle and lower lobe has also
 slightly worsened.

 INDICATION:  Suspicious lung consolidation with VAP in a ___-year-old woman.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Portable semi-erect chest view was read in comparison with prior
 chest radiographs, with the most recent from ___ acquired
 approximately 24 hours apart.
 
 FINDINGS:
 
 Increased retrocardiac density and the left lower lung opacity, which likely
 represents a combination of atelectasis and/or consolidation has minimally
 worsened since ___.  On single frontal view, if any of this 
 represents infection cannot be ruled out and needs further clinical
 correlation.  Right lung is clear. A right internal jugular line sheath ends
 at upper SVC.  Heart size is mild-to-moderately enlarged and unchanged. 
 Mediastinal and hilar contours are unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Right hemidiaphragm has always been elevated relative to the left but the
 differential has been much greater since ___ than it was previously and
 greater today than on ___.  This could be due to varying degrees of
 atelectasis at the right lung base or a phrenic nerve palsy captured at
 different stages in the respiratory cycle.  There could also be a
 space-occupying process in the right upper abdominal quadrant such as
 exacerbation of hepatomegaly or a growing liver mass.  Heart is normal size
 and mediastinum is not shifted at all to the right.  I would recommend
 evaluation of peridiaphragmatic pathology, either fluid or mass.  Left lung is
 clear and there is no left pleural effusion. 
 
 Healed fractures of the posterolateral and anterolateral portions of left
 middle ribs, the latter more recent and not completely healed are new since
 the end of ___, but with enough bony callus to indicate they did not occur
 in the past several weeks.  No pneumothorax.

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH
 
 HISTORY:  Fatigue, anorexia, weight loss with hypoxia and leukocytosis. 
 Background of CREST and chronic interstitial lung disease.
 
 COMPARISONS:  ___.
 
 TECHNIQUE:  Chest, AP and lateral.
 
 FINDINGS:  The heart is at the upper limits of normal size.  The mediastinal
 and hilar contours appear unchanged, including calcification and unfolding
 along the aorta.  There is similar moderate relative elevation of the right
 hemidiaphragm compared to the left.  The mediastinal and hilar contours appear
 unchanged.  There is again a coarse reticular abnormality favoring the bases
 and peripheral aspects of the lung, most consistent with pulmonary fibrosis. 
 Parenchymal findings appear stable allowing for small differences in
 technique.  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.  The lateral view
 depicts air-fluid level in the mediastinum suggesting esophageal fluid which
 could be seen with esophageal dysmotility that may accompany CREST syndrome. 
 In addition, there is a cluster of small densities, possibly pill fragments,
 three altogether projecting near the expected site of the gastroesophageal
 junction.  The bones appear demineralized.
 
 IMPRESSION:  
 
 1.  Stable findings of chronic interstitial lung disease without definite
 evidence for superimposed process.  
 
 2.  Air-fluid level in the esophagus which could be seen with known CREST
 syndrome.  In addition, there is a cluster of small densities, possibly pill
 fragments, three altogether, projecting near the expected site of the
 gastroesophageal junction.  Clinical correlation regarding any potential
 aspiration risk is recommended.

 AP CHEST, 4:39 A.M., ___
 
 HISTORY:  ___-year-old woman with COPD exacerbation.  Has been any change since
 ___?
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___ through ___:
 
 Mild interstitial pulmonary edema is new.  Exacerbation at the base of the
 right lung may be due to asymmetric deposition of edema due to the persistent
 elevation of the right lung base and poor aeration in the lower lobes.  The
 elevation of the right lung base is primarily due to a large chronic right
 pleural effusion.  The elevated and enlarged right hilus, adjacent radiation
 fibrosis and apical pleural thickening are chronic.  A second region of more
 focal edema in the right upper lobe sitting on the minor fissure is probably
 due to disturbed lymphatic drainage from the radiated lung.
 
 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  Small size of nodules in the left lung on
 chest CTA yesterday, I am surprised at the prominence of such nodules today in
 the mid lung.  It would be prudent to repeat this chest radiograph later in
 the day to exclude the development of nodular infection.
 
 Dr. ___ was paged at 9 a.m. when the findings were realized.

 COMPARISON:  Chest radiograph ___ and CT chest ___
 
 FINDINGS: 
 
 Heart size remains mildly enlarged.  Aortic knob is densely calcified.  The
 mediastinal contour is unchanged.  Right hilar opacity is similar to the
 previous examinations.  Rounded opacity projecting over the right mid lung
 field likely reflects fluid loculated within the major fissure. A moderate
 right pleural effusion and trace left pleural effusion are noted, and there is
 mild pulmonary edema.  Patchy opacity in the lung bases may reflect
 atelectasis but infection or aspiration is not excluded.  No pneumothorax is
 present.  Emphysematous changes are again seen in the lungs.
 
 IMPRESSION:
 
 
 1. Mild pulmonary edema and moderate size right and small left pleural
 effusions.  Small amount of fluid is loculated within the right major fissure.

 Current study demonstrates enlarged heart, replaced aortic valve and
 substantial mitral annulus calcifications, unchanged since the prior study. 
 Cardiomegaly is unchanged.  There is diffuse interstitial opacities as well as
 engorgement of azygos vein as well as bilateral small pleural effusions,
 findings most likely consistent with interstitial pulmonary edema.  An
 additional left lower lobe pneumonia is a possibility and potentially other
 areas of infection are present obscured by the interstitial pulmonary edema.

 AP CHEST, 9:50 A.M. ON ___
 
 HISTORY:  ICD placed.  Fever.
 
 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to ___:
 
 Widespread ground-glass pulmonary opacification, probably edema, has recurred
 after earlier improvement between ___.  Though the most likely
 explanation is cardiac, conceivably transfusion of blood products or new
 medication could be responsible.  The greater opacification in the left lower
 lobe is most readily explained by atelectasis in the setting of a very large
 left heart, but pneumonia due to aspiration would be radiographically
 indistinguishable.  Small left pleural effusion is stable.  There is no
 pneumothorax.  Transvenous right ventricular pacer defibrillator lead, left
 ventricular lead, and the posteriorly positioned right atrial lead are all
 unchanged in their respective positions as far as one can tell from a solitary
 frontal radiograph.  No pneumothorax.

 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  COPD, dyspnea, orthopnea and wheezing.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Vague nodular
 opacity projecting over the right lower lung represents atelectasis, less
 likely pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Imaged osseous structures appear
 intact.  No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague nodular opacity projecting over the right lower lung is
 most likely secondary to atelectasis.  Consider repeat radiograph with more

 CHEST RADIOGRAPH PERFORMED ON ___
 
 COMPARISON:  Prior exam from ___.
 
 CLINICAL HISTORY:  COPD, dyspnea, orthopnea and wheezing.
 
 FINDINGS:  PA and lateral views of the chest were provided.  Vague nodular
 opacity projecting over the right lower lung represents atelectasis, less
 likely pneumonia.  No large effusion or pneumothorax is seen.  The
 cardiomediastinal silhouette is stable.  Imaged osseous structures appear
 intact.  No free air is seen below the right hemidiaphragm.
 
 IMPRESSION:  Vague nodular opacity projecting over the right lower lung is
 most likely secondary to atelectasis.  Consider repeat radiograph with more
 optimal inspiratory effort to further assess.

 FINDINGS:
 
 With the patient's neck in flexed position, the endotracheal tube ending
 approximately 7cm above the carina is highly placed.  Consider advancing the
 endotracheal tube by additional 4 cm for better seating.  New left internal
 jugular line ends at the left vertebral margins and is likely within the left
 brachiocephalic trunk.  Considering advancing by additional 2.5 cm to 3 cm. 
 Left PICC line ends at lower SVC.  Both lung volumes are low and remarkable
 for minimal bibasal atelectasis.  No oacities concerning for pneumonia.  A
 thin, curved, radioopaque structure is seen extending from right medial basal
 lung till right hypochrondriac region. Its clinical significance was discussed
 with Dr.___ by phone on ___ at 4.50PM, but my discussion led to
 conclude this as of uncertain nature. I recommend a lateral radiograph for
 further evaluation to see if this is a artifact or real. Orogastric tube is
 seen coursing below the diaphragm into the stomach and is adequately placed. 
 An abdominal drain tube is seen in the left upper abdomen.
