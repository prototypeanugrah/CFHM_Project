"Stable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, better visualized on the lateral than on the frontal view. Persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. "
"Unchanged mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, with platelike atelectasis at the right lung basis. Persistent mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. "
"Unchanged mild elevation of the right hemidiaphragm, with platelike atelectasis at the right lung basis. Stable elevation of the right hemidiaphragm. "
Elevated right hemidiaphragm. Elevated right hemidiaphragm. 
"AP chest compared to ___ at 4:35 p.m.:  Four views of the torso show at the end of the series, a feeding tube with a wire stylet in place coiled in the stomach, and left internal jugular line at the origin of the SVC. Two AP frontal views of the torso show, at 12:13 p.m., a feeding tube with a wire stylet in place looped at the gastroesophageal junction, terminating back in the cervical esophagus. "
"AP chest compared to ___, 7:32 a.m.:  Dobbhoff feeding tube with a wire stylet in place ends in the upper stomach. AP chest compared to ___, 2:47 p.m.  Dobbhoff tube ends in the upper stomach. "
"Lung apices excluded from the examination, centered at the diaphragm. AP chest compared to ___ at 4:35 p.m.:  Four views of the torso show at the end of the series, a feeding tube with a wire stylet in place coiled in the stomach, and left internal jugular line at the origin of the SVC. "
"AP chest compared to ___ through ___:  Mild cardiomegaly and mediastinal vascular engorgement are slightly greater, but there is no pulmonary edema, small right pleural effusion is likely. The mediastinum is widened and mediastinal/aortic injury is not excluded. "
"In comparison with the study of ___, there is little change in the the large cavitary mass in the right lower lung with multiple nodular metastases scattered throughout both sides. All these findings suggest an extensive right upper lung malignancy with local lymphangitic extension and central adenopathy, on both sides of the midline. "
Stable post-surgical changes in the right upper hemithorax. Interval decrease in amount of air within the right apical postsurgical air-fluid collection. 
"Although there is no appreciable right pneumothorax there is new subcutaneous emphysema in the right upper chest wall and neck following surgery which included posterior osteotomy of the right fifth upper rib. AP chest compared to ___ through ___:  Severe widespread subcutaneous emphysema throughout the chest wall and neck, and severe pneumomediastinum are unchanged over the past several days. "
"Volume loss and large cystic spaces in the right upper lung that could be due to previous necrotizing pneumonia and pneumatoceles or the residual of previous surgery. Left hilar mass, consolidation in the lingula, severe emphysema, opacities in the right peripheral mid lung and in the left upper lobe are better evaluated on prior CT. "
Similar appearance of ill-defined right upper lobe opacity likely reflecting a combination of malignancy and post biopsy changes. Large right upper lobe mass as seen on prior CT of the chest. 
"Right pneumothorax has which worsened between ___ and ___ despite the right pigtail pleural drainage catheter in place, has subsequently decreased a great deal, with a small apical residual, pigtail pleural drainage catheter still in place in the right midlung. Chest CTA performed after this study, but available at the time of its review shows pleural fluid loculated along costal, mediastinal, diaphragmatic and fissural pleural surfaces as well as evidence of a small pneumatocyst in the right upper lobe posterior segment that may have been a result of a traumatic chest tube placement. "
"Review of the radiographic record shows episodes of decompensation of chronically enlarged heart, severe emphysema, and right apical tuberculous scarring. In comparison with the study of ___, there is again hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease and enlargement of the cardiac silhouette without evidence of vascular congestion or pleural effusion. "
"Review of the radiographic record shows episodes of decompensation of chronically enlarged heart, severe emphysema, and right apical tuberculous scarring. Bronchiectasis and scarring in the right upper lobe, probably from prior tuberculosis, retracting the hilus and minor fissure, has not changed since ___. "
"___ pattern in the right upper lobe reflects severe emphysema. Emphysema, largely paraseptal was demonstrated by a chest CTA in ___, and bullae are probably responsible for the constellation of ring shadows seen in the right upper lobe at the level of the third anterior rib. "
"Stable hyperinflation consistent with chronic pulmonary disease and emphysema. In comparison with the study of ___, there is again hyperexpansion of the lungs consistent with chronic pulmonary disease. "
"All these findings suggest an extensive right upper lung malignancy with local lymphangitic extension and central adenopathy, on both sides of the midline. Progression of left-sided lung masses, decreased aeration in left hemithorax, On the right side advanced evidence of secondary metastasis in lung, no pneumothorax, no massive pleural effusions that would deserve additional drainage. "
"The small apical component of right pneumothorax is unchanged, but there has been an increase in fluid and air loculations in the right lower chest. Since removal of the right apical pleural drain, the small right pneumothorax, along the lateral apical and medial surfaces in the right upper hemi thorax has increased slightly. "
"Chest CT scan on ___ showed severe emphysema and large areas of irregularly shaped consolidation and pleural parenchymal thickening at both lung apices. All these findings suggest an extensive right upper lung malignancy with local lymphangitic extension and central adenopathy, on both sides of the midline. "
"AP chest compared to ___:  Lungs are hyperinflated, an indication of small airway obstruction or perhaps emphysema, but clear of any focal abnormality. Bullous emphysema is extremely severe, with basal predominance raising possibility of panacinar emphysema due to alpha one antitrypsin deficiency. "
